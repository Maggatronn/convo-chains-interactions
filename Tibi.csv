Now, if you notice three police officers in here, everybody is going to send their kids in here because they know its safe. And they don't even have to stay in here. They would take their car from here, go out and come back. They were always here, that type of thing. Its things like that, is what the Mayor and the Governor need to know, that needs to be in community so that we could feel safe. Or just to have a car parked there. And take his car from there, they're riding around the city doing nothing. I'm serious. I see cop cars all over the place, they're not doing anything to me, they're on their cellphones, they're out there on detail making triple money. Why do they need the detail? If we are not safe, why should they be safe to be parking on the street. I'm talking about the people that are working tho.[crosstalk 00:46:29] in our neighborhood but they're not guarding us.

I think that it's important also to recognize that for many different people, their circumstances are different. You know what I mean? We have different lived experiences and different like economic, we have different I guess ideas of economic stability and lived experiences with that, as well. So my story is like very different from a lot of other people's, but being someone who is the youngest and I never take youngest sibling, you know what I mean, like slander, because I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. But yeah, you know what I mean? Like being the youngest of a household of four children, two of whom were like adopted. It's like, kind of the idea of community that I share, or that I have and that I hold dear, is like very different than a lot of other people. I definitely think that seeing the gentrification that's taking place right now, it's very reminiscent of how the community kind of felt very disparate when I was younger, do you know what I mean? Because, you have people that you're close to, you have your kind of blood relatives and your blood family members and stuff like that. But then you also have these like adopted family members who are like, you want to care about and who are like they're a part of your family and you go to love them and stuff like that. You know what I mean? That's your brothers, your sisters. You feel me? But at the end of the day it's like, there's still always going to be a divide. You know what I mean? I feel like the people that are moving into the neighborhoods, they're not to blame for the gentrification that's taking place. It's more so around the foundations that are being laid by the city to be able to have those people move in. You know what I mean? I think that divide is something that happens a lot. I saw that happen like my own household, just like with adopted siblings and myself. You know what I mean, with my birth mom and sister, it's just like, it's easy for us to fight each other and kind of not like each other, because it's like, ""Oh you're this and this and you know whatever."" But it's not really conducive to an environment that we can all grow and thrive in. You feel me? Like there can be like space for people to be able to live in affordable housing and I mean there can be [inaudible] folks who are, you know what I mean? Like whether they're a part of the artist community or they're a part of the business community, whatever, to be able to find space. Because there shouldn't be that, like one group of people shouldn't be pushed out for another group of people to be able to thrive. You feel me? I feel like until the city has that in mind, so that concept gets through their skulls, we're not going to be able to have a clear understanding of who, of what community actually feels like. You feel me? I think that's difficult, just because obviously we have, you know what I mean? It's kind of just the way that oppression works, you know what I mean, in general.",Nate,,housing.gentrification and displacement,

We get to the level that we can see where the backgrounds, or the people who are there, and how they got to that place that they are now. It'll give some indication of the inequities in Boston.

It talks about the programs and things that we had initiated, such as Healthy Boston, [inaudible] Street. I don't know if you were around at that time? With Healthy Boston, a developed program that was called Ties that Bind. What the purpose of that was, was to bring an intergenerational component to children that were latchkey, what have you. And we did things like put together whale-watch trips, going to the theater. We got donations from the different museums and things of that nature. Keep the children engaged, but also give them some guidance by participating in these different events with the older generation. But we've lost all those. Those were very successful programs. But I would say, if you want to see what was then back in the late eighties, early nineties and stuff, or what have you, This Ain't Normal would be a good show to watch. I know that they're streaming it on Showtime, YouTube, and other things. I don't know if anyone knows Dennis Wilson, but he's one of the [crosstalk]. And he is one of the co-producers of the show. Yeah, and you're absolutely right. There's not enough, very constructive and engaging things for children to do. I see that with my own grandchildren. I have to make these things happen. And with everybody, and being in such a financial slump and stuff, it's very difficult. But especially at this time, we need to start to rebuild these children so that they can have some hope and joy. Like have a childhood? Well, yes. Because the trauma and everything, and that they've experienced in the last year and a half... Seen a huge increase in the bullying, the meanness. So we have a lot of... Again, we have a lot of work to do. For me, this is like, excuse my expression, but, ""It's like shoveling shit against the tide."" We were there in the eighties and the nineties with the drugs and all of that sort of stuff. But I know that things can change because it did.

I'm not a native New Englander. I am from Georgia. And I was born and grew up in the heart of the civil rights era. So I definitely have my own view and my own interpretation of things that I see and things that happen around me. And the one thing that my father was constantly working to drill and instill in us is to know and to understand who's at the table. And he was one of those people that, if there wasn't a table, he'd build one. And you don't leave people out. The best way to have a community conversation is to have everyone from the community. Those close by, even those folk who are far away, you include them in the conversation. And I look at where we are now on my street, on Brinsley street. We used to know everybody on our street.

I was not thinking actively about what's specifically out there for young kids in our area now, versus what may have been there a decade ago. I mean, I don't have any... I call them little people. I don't have any little people in my house, so that's not on the front of my brain. My son works in education and he is a tennis player and tennis instructor. And one of our commitments to the community has always been to be there and make ourselves available. And we've done that primarily through the tennis club because that was our family outlet. So if you would ask me, I would say, ""Oh my goodness, yes, there's always stuff out there. There are things to do and places to be,"" because we literally had this sports facility incorporated into our life. And I wasn't necessarily forced to think broader than that, because beyond that, when David talked about the church, I was that youth fellowship director who had no problems throwing all the kids in the back of my truck and we'd all go to the movies. I took them all out to Worcester, to concerts or whatever. So those were the kinds of things that were happening, but you know what? As I listened, I realized that's what was going on in my little world. It wasn't universal. It wasn't the thing that was happening across the community. And I think that we got to think, or at least I do. I've got to think bigger, I've got to think broader. And I've got to think outside of things that touch me.

To engage them, to encourage them, but to also talk to them about how they could apply some of those same skills, some of those innate abilities that David was talking about. How to recognize them, how to even point them out to them, because kids don't even... Man, they don't know how brilliant they are. And so he makes it a point to talk to them about that. So for me, I'm like, ""Okay, so that's a good use of your passion for music by using that as a conduit, to connect with young people and to pay it forward a bit."" But, I think that in the grand scheme of things, we all have to do a better job of understanding what the issues and the concerns are that are outside of our sphere. Being willing to look beyond that, because when you start to do that, that means that you may be required to do more, you may be required to do differently. And some of us... I would love to think that I'm exempt from all of that. I'd love to call it ""dues paid"" and move ahead. But that's just not the world that we're living in right now.",Alveta,,,

My parents were those parents, they would just throw a bunch of kids in their minivan and we would go anywhere and everywhere. My dad would always take the family and at least three or four of my friends. And these are kids from the city, from Brooklyn, and take them camping, take them hiking, having those experiences that they never had. So I definitely feel you on that one. I feel like I'm always taking people, places in my car now. But something that I'm reminded of just being on this call is the wisdom of the elders. And I mean that in the most respectful way.[crosstalk]. We're old. Oh no. No, just a few years. But no, just hearing all of you share and just the lives you've lived, the work that you've been involved in, the things that you're passionate about and that you care about just reminds me that there is work that we can all do together. That it really is a bridge. It really has to be intergenerational. I think it's so easy. Millennials, especially Gen Z, to just sometimes feel like quote-unquote, I'll use that lightly, ""Y'all don't get it"" or, ""Y'all, don't relate,"" but I think that would be lazy on our part to just assume that, because you didn't grow up in the age of the internet or social media, whatever, that your thoughts and your ideas don't have credence anymore.","David, Alveta, Gail",,,

Mine is what does the climate control look like because there's a concern about the water levels rising, and what does that look like and who is in charge of that project that needs to be discussed with the homeowners and the business owners and the commuters and other people that can be affected. In addition to that if there was a situation, well there will be a situation. It's just a matter of time. They say what does that evacuation look like? Where is that discussion at because that's really important for people that live in the community that don't know? I know there were some evacuation signs, but I was told there really wasn't ... And the other thing is the tyranny that goes along with we voted for cannabis and consumption, and the stigmatization that went along with people who did smoke cannabis. And then you have these judges that lock up a lot of cannabis users. And now some of these judges, I wouldn't say all of them, but I wouldn't be surprised if they're not in the cannabis industry. Those judges that sent these young, and I say black and brown and Latino people to jail including my loved one. My family was incarcerated because they were an addict and they used drugs to provide for their addiction. What about crime? But they still did jail time unlike the addicts of today that they want to find them injection centers. They're not injection centers but there are places where they can go and indulge in the activity of their choice. They want to provide shelters for these addicts of today. They want to put them on Front Street in the prime areas where there's business owners. There's a black hotel down there. We won't even know that it's a black hotel. When it was open, we did very much go over there and have a great time, but now with the drug addiction people that are surrounding those areas who's helping those business owners to get back to the level where they deserve to get the revenue that they deserve. But because of the eyesore like where's that conversation at. And the consumerism, we can go into the cigar bars and you can go into the bars and you can do hookah, and you can do cigars. You can't do cannabis, but we voted for that, like you owe us that. There's tyranny there. And who's talking about that? It's not okay. It's just not okay. And then I know there's a whole 2030 Boston blueprint and what it's supposed to look like, the metropolis that they're building around us. We don't see that in the urban community unless you go down to City Hall and you're aware of ... We'll just go over all of it. If you're aware of the protocol that they have for that. And the last thing is Nathaniel Holland Fenway Park. Those parks are for the people, but the people can't use them. In other words, there was just a write-up in the Globe that Fenway had never had lined the Urban Act in the whole history of the Fenway Park. I have never, ever wanted to say, ""Hey son, let's go to Fenway Park for an hour."" Never, and I take my kids on a lot of outings.

Mine is what does the climate control look like because there's a concern about the water levels rising, and what does that look like and who is in charge of that project that needs to be discussed with the homeowners and the business owners and the commuters and other people that can be affected. In addition to that if there was a situation, well there will be a situation. It's just a matter of time. They say what does that evacuation look like? Where is that discussion at because that's really important for people that live in the community that don't know? I know there were some evacuation signs, but I was told there really wasn't ... And the other thing is the tyranny that goes along with we voted for cannabis and consumption, and the stigmatization that went along with people who did smoke cannabis. And then you have these judges that lock up a lot of cannabis users. And now some of these judges, I wouldn't say all of them, but I wouldn't be surprised if they're not in the cannabis industry. Those judges that sent these young, and I say black and brown and Latino people to jail including my loved one. My family was incarcerated because they were an addict and they used drugs to provide for their addiction. What about crime? But they still did jail time unlike the addicts of today that they want to find them injection centers. They're not injection centers but there are places where they can go and indulge in the activity of their choice. They want to provide shelters for these addicts of today. They want to put them on Front Street in the prime areas where there's business owners. There's a black hotel down there. We won't even know that it's a black hotel. When it was open, we did very much go over there and have a great time, but now with the drug addiction people that are surrounding those areas who's helping those business owners to get back to the level where they deserve to get the revenue that they deserve. But because of the eyesore like where's that conversation at. And the consumerism, we can go into the cigar bars and you can go into the bars and you can do hookah, and you can do cigars. You can't do cannabis, but we voted for that, like you owe us that. There's tyranny there. And who's talking about that? It's not okay. It's just not okay. And then I know there's a whole 2030 Boston blueprint and what it's supposed to look like, the metropolis that they're building around us. We don't see that in the urban community unless you go down to City Hall and you're aware of ... We'll just go over all of it. If you're aware of the protocol that they have for that. And the last thing is Nathaniel Holland Fenway Park. Those parks are for the people, but the people can't use them. In other words, there was just a write-up in the Globe that Fenway had never had lined the Urban Act in the whole history of the Fenway Park. I have never, ever wanted to say, ""Hey son, let's go to Fenway Park for an hour."" Never, and I take my kids on a lot of outings. And the other thing is the youth center, when I played football and one of the things I always was very happy about in all the years that I played with my children is when we go to those games the people who support them always had a banner, so we knew who the business owners that support our children. In Northeast, I never had one. And I'll end it with that.",Claudette,,*identity of others.formerly incarcerated,

And I think after a couple surgeries I just decided to have a hysterectomy on my own because they kept growing back, but they really don't tell you all of the options like shrinking them or having ablation and doing a lot of things because they really don't know. They just kind of sweep it under the rug until you really have a medical issue where people are really hemorrhaging or people are forced to have a hysterectomy because your fibroids are so large. It does contribute, too, for women that have fibroids with infertility because basically that's what the fibroids do. It's blocking your uterus so that you can't carry. I've seen that happen to a lot of friends and family, and people feel shunned about it so people don't talk up about it, and when you talk up about it then you can get more educated by it.",Karen,,public health.quality and affordable healthcare,

I mean, some were initially skeptical, but a lot of them were appreciative that I was willing to ask for the signature and take time to listen to them, even though, for a variety of reasons, including the fact that the addresses don't get updated in the city, a lot of the signatures probably wouldn't count, but I thought the right thing to do was to listen and do that kind of thing. That made me realize, you know, and it was apparent from conversations that a lot of people did not take the time and did not take time to engage people in that kind of situation that way. I was like, okay, maybe there should be a way to engage them when it's not in those kind of accidental, although not in a bad way, circumstances.",Peter,,inequality.class-based,

Where I work at now, I work in the program that helps a lot of people who are interested in learning English.

I know a lot of times, a lot of people come in, and they will feel frustrated, or they will feel not heard. I always try my best to make sure that anyone who's coming in for these classes, they feel heard, and that they feel appreciated, and that they feel valued, because they are. Just because there's this communication barrier doesn't mean that we can't still relate with one another's stories or life paths, so I really appreciate you asking that question. It really reflects with me, with my work, and everything, and all the people I meet with different backgrounds. I also agree with Peter, as well. I think it's a great question you asked.

And I think that there really needs to be a, just general guide for people our age, or for people who are maybe voting for the first time, that just gives you an idea of how to do it, how the system works, in a way that isn't politicized.

The fact that we have people that are privileged trying to dictate the entrance exam to Latin Academy, so that people like my child or your child could not get in or have a fair shot at it, is disheartening.

I don't even see myself in Boston. I'm trying to hold on in Boston, but eventually I'm going to be forced out. Right now, I'm going through a separation. So I lived in a house with me and my husband and my mother-in-law, who owned the house. But when she passed, in her will, she said, ""Sell the house.""

It's not about the people. It's not about the people. It's true. It's about [crosstalk]- Look at the face of the Seaport. There are barely any Black businesses there. And that's a beautiful space, but you don't see our kind there. You look at all the new malls- Nothing is for us. If they really want to do something, they need to make a section of Boston, give it to our people, and let us build that place up. Okay- Let us build for us by us. But they won't want that to happen, because they done gave Boston to the wealthy. They done gave Boston- Not to mention that would be less dollars going to the neighborhoods that they wanted to go to, and therefore negates their whole purpose of being. They have given Boston away. Most of all my friends and family that grew up in the South End back in the day, they're all every place, Randolph, Brockton, Stoughton. It's nobody really here anymore. And that's what they do.

We pay the tax dollars, and the money gets circulated throughout the state. They budget for policing overtime, I think, was, what, 30 million or something like that the past two years. They have a new women's prison coming up, and they're planning to spend $50 million on that one. You don't have any money going into [crosstalk]- Speaking of, do you know that there's a new proposal on this particular ballot that's going to change the way that the mayor budgets and to give the city council more leeway into managing that budget?

Yes, [crosstalk], yes. See, they keep telling us that all the time. They're saying, ""Fill out the census. This is for services in your community. We want to see where the services are most needed.""

And that's not fair to them when they go up against these kids who are actually being taught, and therefore they lose out on the seats, like the Boston Latin and the Boston academies. If we don't get something in gear... We don't have buildings that are adequate. They don't even have air conditioning. You've got mice in the stairwell. Kids are getting moldy lunches. And yet and still, you tell me there's a budget for school lunch, but then you're serving the kids salami. What are you doing with the money realistically? Because I know all of the money that's in budget is not being dwarfed by a sandwich of cold salami. Someone really needs to think about why everybody's pushing their kids to charter school, because no one wants their kid in a Boston public education, because it's not there. So that's key, because you can't have the next level working force of these educated kids, if they're not educated. And then you wonder why they're hanging on the corners, because a lot of times the parents get discouraged. They can't keep track of the kids. The kids feel burdened, because they see their moms struggling. And then they go and resort to things, so that they can try and help. And then they end up being profiled, and then they end up being in a system. And then you end up with all the things that are happening every day on the news. And then they look at us like we're savages, and we don't know what we're doing. But a lot of times you have kids raising kids. If you've got young kids, and then they don't have that matriarch to give them the education, to give them the knowledge that they need and the support and structure. So if the services were there, if the housing was out of the way, and they weren't worried about the landlord kicking them out or raising their rent or whatever the case, or family members having to stay with them, because they've been kicked out, we'd have less struggle there. And therefore, they could concentrate on other things and give the kids the attention, be at the parent teacher meetings, like they should be, and be involved, and be a voice in the community like they should.

I feel you, Kimberly, about getting denied. We've been denied a lot, trying to get my friend's house because they don't have rent... Specifically because I don't have rental history, it took us months and months and months. Then I also helped a friend who was coming home from a 30-year bid get an apartment. Luckily, we finally found somebody in the neighborhood who had family who was incarcerated and was willing to take somebody in because they know that that doesn't mean you're a bad person. So yeah, I guess I'm relating that experience of supporting my two friends this past summer to find housing but they got denied time after time. Sometimes people would just not even give them a denial, just stop talking to them once they found out they didn't have a rental history or they had a record so I feel both those things really deeply.",Elizabeth,,*type of highlight.resonating experience,
