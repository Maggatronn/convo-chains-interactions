And then, as Dorothy had said, they tend to... When you come up with an issue with the house and the quick build of that, money rules the factor of giving these contractors the job to do something, and then they use cheap materials and product.

So, my mom, I was blessed to have my mom. My mom, God rest her soul, she passed away 11 years ago. But, my family was always a firm believer in making sure that your family had some place to go. So, my mom passed. She passed the house on to me and my brother, and I was able to have that. So, don't ever say, ""I need to get my credit."" Listen, you're going to get there. I hear you. A lot of my friends have had to move to Middleborough and Taunton and Fall River, and just Braintree. They were in shelters and they have the kids, the same, but they had to move out to get a three bedroom. They can't get stay in Boston. None of my friends that I grew up with are here. They're all out in East wherever, and I'm like, ""I can't visit y'all."" I'm just here because my mom left me a house. That's why. And I'm thankful for that, it's a lot, but that's why. It's not because ... well, I worked on my credit, but that's not why. Yeah, it is sad that we can't stay here and we can't raise our kids here. This is where we grew up at. I grew up here. I don't know what's going to happen when she gets old enough to take over if something happens to me, my older daughter or something like that. I don't know what's going to happen, because I don't know if anybody can afford to live here. The taxes are ridiculous here. So, people are moving out. I've questioned whether should I still stay here. I used to walk from my house to Tufts Medical Center when my mother got sick. I cannot walk from my house to Tufts Medical Center anymore because I'm scared to. And remember, I'm 47, so I grew up in the '90s and I wasn't scared of anything. I could walk up and down Washington Street and walk everywhere and walk downtown. But I'm scared now, because of Mass and Cass. I can't walk through the side streets anymore. I would not dare do that. So if there was something that we could do to find out if we could get those three bedrooms, but everything that they're building right now doesn't even have a three bedroom attached to it. It's always a loft or they're building $500,000 condos or lofts. They're splitting that.

It was a three family house we were living in, raise my rent from 700 to 1100 in one year and I had to move. And so, we moved to Jamaica Plain. And then several years later... I mean, I was real mad and angry, even though I was a leader of the Brookline Tenant Union, coordinated the entire towns' election and all the 20 precincts, and I just felt powerless and just left and contested. Anyway, a couple of years later, in '95 or '96, I was renting in Jamaica Plain, and a friend of mine [Chrissolio] who had become a realtor, who I knew from years ago, told me about this first-time home buyers program that the city ran. That if you went to this class downtown you could get a $2,000 grant or loan that would turn into a grant from the city to buy a home if you were a first-time home buyer. And it was for low-income people, which I wasn't making a lot of money at the time so I qualified. And so, I went through this, got the thing, and I found an apartment, 94 Forest Hills Street, in Jamaica Plain, for $72,000 and was able to buy it through this first-time home buyers thing. I got a grant, I got a special, soft second mortgage through the Mass Affordable Housing Alliance and bought this place. And I lived there for several years. Later, Jessica and I got married, we moved to Arlington, I still own it. That apartment, it's your basic triple decker, tens of thousands of other triple deckers, not the whole building, just one floor, a thousand square feet, two bedrooms and a front room is now assessed by the city at about $500,000.

It was a three family house we were living in, raise my rent from 700 to 1100 in one year and I had to move. And so, we moved to Jamaica Plain. And then several years later... I mean, I was real mad and angry, even though I was a leader of the Brookline Tenant Union, coordinated the entire towns' election and all the 20 precincts, and I just felt powerless and just left and contested. Anyway, a couple of years later, in '95 or '96, I was renting in Jamaica Plain, and a friend of mine [Chrissolio] who had become a realtor, who I knew from years ago, told me about this first-time home buyers program that the city ran. That if you went to this class downtown you could get a $2,000 grant or loan that would turn into a grant from the city to buy a home if you were a first-time home buyer. And it was for low-income people, which I wasn't making a lot of money at the time so I qualified. And so, I went through this, got the thing, and I found an apartment, 94 Forest Hills Street, in Jamaica Plain, for $72,000 and was able to buy it through this first-time home buyers thing. I got a grant, I got a special, soft second mortgage through the Mass Affordable Housing Alliance and bought this place. And I lived there for several years. Later, Jessica and I got married, we moved to Arlington, I still own it. That apartment, it's your basic triple decker, tens of thousands of other triple deckers, not the whole building, just one floor, a thousand square feet, two bedrooms and a front room is now assessed by the city at about $500,000. I mean, that's crazy to me. So, how can anyone... I mean, I could never buy that house now, even though I make good money. And my daughter who moved to Phil... She's 48, bought a house in Philadelphia for 200 and something thousand dollars, could never, even though she makes a lot of money with her partner. So, that's my question. And that's my story. I mean, I was able to do it because I'm old, I'm 74, in '95/'96 I could buy this place with 72,000 and maybe by inflation, it might be 150 if normal inflation would take place, but it's 500.

But the problem with the housing issue that both of us faced is really the same that Boston does not have a lot of housing stock and the housing stock they're building is not going to help, because it doesn't serve families, and children, especially, these high rises are very dangerous for children. There's nowhere for them to play and so forth, so the housing issue still is critical to many groups of people whether they're homeowners or tenants, whether they're young, or old, or retired, or students, we all are vying for the same piece of the pie here. And the pie is very small to begin with, because this is a small town and this is the problem. Boston has always been a small town and we've always been somewhat in denial about it. And the problem now is, is because the other issue involving construction has reduced the amount of green space.

There are many issues, security issues surrounding the business that I have to deal with. And also my commercial. I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand what you mean by security issues surrounding the business [crosstalk]? My inventory's worth a great deal of money. And this building has security, but it's not the greatest, and increasingly we're a bit... But also the crime has increased, we are, according to the police report, there were 12 break-ins in the Brighton Center area just last weekend. This is another concern. So, it's a whole bunch of issues really, but they all point in the same direction, frankly, that I need to leave. And do you have any particular town or city you're thinking of [crosstalk] to? Well, actually, somebody suggested Lowell, because of the art scene. I don't know, I do know someone who has property there, but it's not a single-family house, so I don't know.

Oh, yeah. Michael, I wouldn't even consider doing it here anymore. Not only because... [crosstalk] It's because... Here's the problem that we're facing. This gets into politics, and voting, that's another issue I wanted to talk about, but the problem here is that I walked through Brighton every day on my way to work and home after home is no longer a single-owner home.

When I talk about my story, it's painful, it's like reliving trauma. I talk about the times being spit on by drunken white boys and go on to Cub Scout when I was nine years old. That's painful to talk about, because I could still smell the liquor in the spit, which has a bad smell. I mean, I talk about being a young kid growing up in Mission Hill running a major community center and was initiated with Charles Stuart murder when a pregnant white woman was alleged killed by a black man, and those are all a hunt for every black men, civil rights savagely violated, pants pulled down in front of the center, I was going to become the director, couldn't happen to me.

Bringing it back to Boston, what we need to understand, Boston is the gateway to all other towns in the state of Massachusetts, because everything begins with Boston. If you notice, when they have championships or whatever, they always have the parades in Boston. And if you notice, people that work in the suburbs, they come to Boston to work. I mean, they live in the suburbs. They come to Boston to work. So, Boston is the gateway to all the other towns in Massachusetts. Boston is always going to be around, may the future look dim or bright. What these candidates need to understand, they need to be accounted, like she said, for the things that go on in Boston. Boston is not a forgotten town. Boston is [inaudible]. Everyone all across the world know about Boston for sports, or for its history, and whatever.

There are lots of bad reasons. I know that they're lots bad reasons, but I grew up in a college town in Vermont and so I had an excellent education. And I came to Boston and I was committed to having my three sons go through the Boston Public School system, which they did. They graduated. They went all the way. But of course, they were smart white boys, and they were tracked well, so they probably got the best of the resources, but I know that. So I had an older son and then twin sons. The Twins were in 5th grade in an advance work program and because they were twins, they were placed in different classes, which is partly my hope that they wouldn't live as twins, that they would have their own lives. So they were placed in different classes and because of that, they had different teachers the year before they were supposed to go to where they would go to high school. I guess that was middle school. Sorry. That must have been fifth grade just before the sixth grade.

There are lots of bad reasons. I know that they're lots bad reasons, but I grew up in a college town in Vermont and so I had an excellent education. And I came to Boston and I was committed to having my three sons go through the Boston Public School system, which they did. They graduated. They went all the way. But of course, they were smart white boys, and they were tracked well, so they probably got the best of the resources, but I know that. So I had an older son and then twin sons. The Twins were in 5th grade in an advance work program and because they were twins, they were placed in different classes, which is partly my hope that they wouldn't live as twins, that they would have their own lives. So they were placed in different classes and because of that, they had different teachers the year before they were supposed to go to where they would go to high school. I guess that was middle school. Sorry. That must have been fifth grade just before the sixth grade. And so, one of the twins went Boston Latin and the other one to Boston Latin Academy because of the teachers they had because the one who went to Boston Latin Academy had the really tough teacher who felt that she needed to treat all the kids as though they were in boot camp.

It just seems like there's always another roadblock and it seems to be affecting certain population and maybe less impacting others. So that's a concern that I see growing as we progress. I don't see that getting easier.",Jesus,,education.higher education,

So my oldest that went to private school, went through Stepping Stone. That's how he was able to get into private school in financial aid and everything else that brings. A lot of it is resources. But even within those resources and those programs that are available, they are limited. So from my three kids, the oldest got accepted, the other two didn't make it. So okay, you have to take a different path. One of my concerns now looking at colleges, so you have your UMass Boston Amherst etcetera. Before, those were safety schools. You didn't make it into one of those, you got into the one at UMass. Now, it's not a safety school anymore. It's difficult to get into any one of them.

So it was good to know that there is still a community.",Ian Loud,,,

So just thinking of that, pushing people while pushing students and pushing youths and letting them know that they have so much potential to get wherever they want. And that's with resources and with the people in the right corner, just like a lot of us had mentors and a lot of us have resources, they could definitely get to wherever they want when they believe in themselves and they push themselves to get to wherever they want to go.",Daphne,,,

And through these conversations that you see how many things, I think someone else said it before, like you're not alone in your struggle and there's things that connect all of us and having that space to be able to talk about it and get out the frustrations or things we're scared about is important because that's how we make the difference and the change, is by first one acknowledging it, talking through it and figuring out steps from there.

78,Current - Dimitra,1512,2021-10-05,5244556,4041.2,4169.1,Dimitra Dimitrakopoulou,Takeaway,"I was just wondering based on what many people shared, how can we actually become more effective at raising awareness of people's struggles and those multi-generational inequities that certain communities have come through so others can actually better understand why is it that there their equity in one way or another was built at the expense of building inequity for others. Actually there is a disconnect there and that's based on my experiences. People are being around with the different circles that have been, and the underlying concepts there is that when some people are forced to end up in unequal circumstances than many people, they blame them for making bad choices. Yeah, so we then read the inequality evidence of a broken system structure that produces inequality. But as the inability of those individuals to be as successful as the rest of us, so we put all the blame on them. That's because we don't have the ability to actually understand what struggles they actually went through and in some cases, well, they don't know better. But then if we do know better, how can we become more effective at helping them understand that those obstacles are real and that there should be mechanisms to actually break those barriers down.",Hugo,,,
