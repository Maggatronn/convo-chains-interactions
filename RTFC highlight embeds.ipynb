Sometimes it\\'s not just about weapons. I\\'m going to get a little bit intimate here and share something that happened to me recently. Last winter, I was in crisis and I had lost my phone. Well, actually my phone had broke and then I had lost it. It was raining really bad that day. And I went into crisis and I was looking for a phone to use. I was near a friend\\'s house. So I said, let me walk to this friend\\'s house because usually they are at home, maybe I can use their phone and get a ride back to my house or whatever I got to do. So I was on my way to the friend\\'s house and I saw the friend in that area. So I didn\\'t even make it to their house. And I was asking them, \"Oh hey, my phone got wet in the rain. I don\\'t have a bus pass. I need to call a ride. Can I use your phone?\" And they was like, \"Oh, my phone\\'s off. I\\'m going to go pay my bill now.\" So I was going to go with them to pay their bill. So I asked, \"Can I just walk with you or whatever?\" And they act like they didn\\'t know me. So that led me to go to wait for them at their house. They said, I could wait for them at their house because they didn\\'t know how long it was going to take. So I got a little antsy. So I knocked on a neighbor\\'s door and they opened the door and I asked them, I said, \"Hey, I need some help. I just need to use a phone. I\\'m a friend of your neighbors.\" And I\\'ve seen them before and they\\'ve seen me before and they just started attacking. So you can imagine how strange that was. It was a very serious altercation. It was more than one person attacking me. Someone called the ambulance because I was obviously beaten up and I had to go to Boston Medical and mind you, I still had no phone. And my family started worrying about me. They had to put a missing persons report because remember I had no phone, I wasn\\'t home. And I was never able to use someone else\\'s phone. And it bothered me that when somebody could be needing help or something and they knock on your door and the first thing you do is attack them, you don\\'t try to give, you know what I mean, help them out and see if there\\'s anything, if they need to use a phone or if you could show them where the ... just help out instead of ... like, the first instinct was for these people to attack me.

And they keep saying we need to get the guns off the street, we need to get the guns off the street, but I have yet to hear a plan to get the guns off the streets. So, I don't know how they can ever stop the pandemic or the epidemic of the gun violence if there's really no plan. I don't know. You want to get it off the street, but what's the plan? What's the plan to do it? So, yes, I definitely resonate with that question and then even take it further to think about the process to see how we eliminate the problem. And then also with the MBTA, it's been a long time since I've taken the MBTA, but I know that it has always been an issue for us in our community. And I don't know if it's because people just didn't care or if it wasn't important to them, that it was important to us to get to where we needed to get to on time so that we can keep our jobs or that we don't have to experience detention in school. Because that was my issue back then when I did have an issue with the MBTA is that, if the bus was late and then crowded on top of that, it would just pass us by. And so, I would always get to school late and I don't care what time I got up to try to make it early if all the students trying to get to school early too. So, the buses were crowded, so they just keep going, you know? So, yes, I can resonate with both question and experience with the buses.\",\n",

And it's not, I get it with the young kids, the teenagers, there's certain areas and communities that are being targeted for... they're being pipelined. The drugs, the guns, they don't have that in Wellesley. They don't have... and it wouldn't happen in Newton. You know what I mean, and all this other stuff? So it's been pipelined. It's targeted. I'm real passionate about this too. But when you do that to a community it's not just the young people that are affected, everybody is affected. You have grandmothers who are being evicted because of things that are happening in... We need to find out how we can stop this? How do we stop our communities from this? What are those other communities doing that's keeping it out of their communities? There's no gun manufacturers in Roxbury. There's no poppy fields in Roxbury, Dorchester. Those drugs are coming in, and they're being pipelined directly. This is targeted. So, we need to trace it back. How can we stop it at source? So, that's one thing because, it does affect the safety of the seniors. We're easy targets, and it's tough. We have things that spring up like Mass and Cass. This is just... I came through there the other day when I was coming from Best Buy, trying to get robbed for my computer issues, and when the taxi turned the corner, it was like we came into a different planet. I looked on both sides... I haven't been down there because it used to be that when you came off of the highway you could see that it wasn't a...
