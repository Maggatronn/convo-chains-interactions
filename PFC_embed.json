If you're on the highway, don't ever go more than seven miles per hour over. And suddenly, there were flashing lights behind my car.\nMy roommates that were in the car with me, were like, \"Are you speeding?\" They both leaned over and looked at my speedometer, and saw that I was going seven miles per hour over. I was pulled over and told that I was speeding, going almost 20 miles per hour over the speed limit. And, I was cooperative, and said, \"I would never go 20 miles per hour over the speed limit. I was paying attention to my speedometer, my roommates here saw it too.\" And, the police officer just got upset with me, and was incredibly rude. I said, \"Could this be a mistake? Could it be that maybe there was another car next to me going that quickly?\"\nThe police officer just treated me as if I was lying. And as a young girl, it was scary, and I felt that I was... I don't think I felt that I was being targeted. But, I felt that I was being treated unfairly in that instance.

So, my very first personal interaction with police that way... I felt that the first police officer I talked to was either lying, or wouldn't listen to me, and there was nothing that I could do to prove what I was doing.\nObviously, this is as very small incident in comparison to what a lot of people's interactions with police are. But, that was how I started out seeing police. Outside of my little small town there, I'd never interacted with them.

To put a deaf person in handcuffs, how can they communicate? They can't. It's impossible. They need their hands to be free so they can express themselves.

Perhaps they were very ... perceived as angry and their body language gave off the intimidating vibe for the police officers, so they put the person into handcuffs. Really it ended up being the victim and not the perpetrator that was placed into handcuffs. So trying to communicate to these officers that the victim's not mad at you. They're trying to express themselves. The history of oppression that has been going on for many, many years, especially with law enforcement, even makes it worse.\nThat was definitely a big component of the trainings that we provided and Deaf Unity is going to move forward with providing more trainings for law enforcement.\nKyle\nThis is Kyle.\nI wanted to add to that specific situation. Most of the time when you were ... maybe an officer enters a residence of a hearing and deaf person they always approach the person who can hear because it's easier for them to communicate, but that's more triggering.

He was involved with incarceration since the age of 13. He grew up in a family that had a father that struggled with mental health, and alcohol, and drug abuse. He lashed out. He was a kid who didn't have an outlet, or a support system, and he did things he shouldn't have done. But, instead of seeing a young man who was growing up and needed support, he was treated like there was something wrong with him.\nHe was incarcerated multiple times. He developed problems with alcohol and drugs on his own. And, this last year, in 2019, he was arrested without any proof when his girlfriend overdosed in his apartment, when he wasn't there. He was held in jail. He wasn't given representation. And, eventually, it was proven that he didn't do anything. And, they had to release him, because they had not proof. But, because of that, they released him off paper. So, he no longer had a parole officer. But, that meant he didn't have access to the same things he had before, to treatment, to medical care, to mental health things in the same way that he had, in the way that he needed to get it.\nAnd, in the last month of his life, he was really struggling. He was very depressed over the loss of his girlfriend. He was finally in his own apartment though. He had a job. He was doing well in those areal that he wanted to succeed in. And, a week before he died, he felt really depressed. He couldn't sleep because he was sick, which looking back on, was very similar to what the symptoms of coronavirus were. And, he called St. Mary's hospital, because they had helped him before. Because, he wanted to either check himself in, or get some kind of support, so he could stop using drugs, and get clean, and get healthy. So that way, he could deal with his depression.\nAnd, St. Mary's called the police on him, and they came to his apartment, and told him, \"We'll either tase you and bring you in now, or you'll allow us to handcuff you, and you take you to detox.\" And, then where they took him, he had to be strapped to a metal bed with leather straps to detox, alone, on his own. And what he needed, was support. And, the police in this community, and the communities across our country, don't look at people who need support, and people who need someone to guide them, or just be there for them through their struggles. They see them as a problem. They're not a problem. They are people.\nAnd if my brother would have gotten that kind of help and support, instead of being treated like he was a problem in Madison for over half of his life, he would still be here today. And, this is just one story of so many in our community. And to me, knowing all of the interactions that he had with police, and how they treated him, and how they treated my family, I don't have trust in the police system to be able to give people that kind of support right now.

They somehow got on the subject of free cheese, the government cheese, and making grilled cheese sandwiches over summer, because they were both so poor.\nThey ended up becoming really good friends, and a couple of those officers stayed working with us. And, my intent behind that was that if an officer in a few weeks, sees one of my students having a mental health struggle, or angry, or an outburst, and they happen to be the officer, they can say, \"Whoa, whoa, wait. I've had a personal experience with this person, and something's just not right here.\" Because, to me, that is the only way you change people. You have to hear their story.

And I don't know, it was like, I had this whole thing like, I'm never doing that again. I don't need to go tour this thing.

And this is where the gap is. And it's a gap that needs to be filled. How do you do that? I don't know, not fund $148 million jail project. That's where the big issue that I see with the Dane County jail, it's that there is so much money being put on the line to build a concrete building downtown was supposed to keep people locked up when you could be investing that same amount of money into a community center or into resources that would actually deal with the very issues that we have with police.\nThat's where I think the second BLM movement that's been going on in 2020 has shown is that we do not invest in non-policing resources, whether it be mental health resources at the city, whether it be just regular health department in the city of Madison, or really any social service that could be actually taking care of these issues and limiting the police role to what they are good at, which is what Anthony has mentioned before, which is keeping us safe in those high ... not high violence, but those really violent crimes that occur.", "rootx": 371.5772519181015, "rooty": 576.4914112706339, "topic1": "Criminal Justice", "topic2": "Non-Policing Resources", "used": true, "story": "solution", "priority": false, "notes": "none"}, {"words": "thinking about England, our police are unarmed individuals. At least they don't have firearms and they're the ones who respond to the vast majority of situations, which I think for the most part is appropriate. And then when we do have violent things happening like someone stabbing a bunch of people on London Bridge, there are armed police officers there within like 10 seconds. And I don't know how they do that. But for the majority of things we call police for, we have unarmed police officers or sometimes they even are community police officers. So I think this isn't unique to Madison in this country, but the fact that our police in general all carry firearms and are trained to use them in high tension situations and they're responding to high tension situations that don't necessarily call for a gun. I think there are very few non-policing resources in Madison.\nOne of the reasons why that is not great is because of what police are, which is, armed people with training to use guns to deescalate situations or use that power or threats of violence. So I think if the model of police here was the majority or the patrol and police were unarmed, I think that would make a larger chunk of what the police do more appropriate and then having those armed individuals. And as a relatively small amount of land that Madison is, I think they would be still be able to respond fairly quickly with armed when it was called for.\nEliza", "rootx": 491.7695118747188, "rooty": 459.9932332192698, "topic1": "Criminal Justice", "topic2": "Armed Officers", "used": false, "story": "solution", "priority": false, "notes": "none"}, {"words": "And going off of Anthony's point, let's look at who's being arrested. What are they being arrested for? I know we're not arresting folks for cannabis anymore in Dane County, but are we arresting folks for heroin use or cocaine use? That is a public health issue. But they should be not be put in jail during that arrest. They should be seeking services from a hospital, seeking services from a center that is built through this fund or if the center is located in the new jail, great, but we should be looking at systemically, what can we reform? What can we change? Because if we are going to decrease the capacity that the jail is going to hold, then we need to look at, okay, what constitutes someone's liberty being taken away?

She has often described that the kids who can't control their behavior are running the classroom a lot of the time, and that's a big concern for other kids. I don't agree either with seclusion and restraints and these kind of horrific way to dealing with this, but how do we get to where everyone gets to get the education, everyone feels safe, like the kids who do have emotional problems and the kids who don't?\nHow do we make those so that both of those groups can somehow survive, get what they want out of it and people feel safe?

It was so hard to get people to respond in the right way when that happened, it was really hard.

He took the ball, literally my son took the ball from him, wouldn't give it back, he turned around and he got wailed on from behind.\nAnd I kept having to go to court over this, and it was like I had to remind people of what happened because they set up this whole program for this kid, and he violated every single one of the guidelines that they set up for him and yet he was still at the school, walking the halls by himself and people were afraid of his kid. And these are the kinds of things that happen. I feel like there was an out of control thing happening here. Why does anyone in the school need to be in fear of their own safety?\nWhen you know what this person did for some reason you're afraid to do something more about this. And I kept going to court and saying, \"I want this kid to get help. I see some of him in me or some of me in him, I used to be like that in some ways.\" But at the same time, all the other kids in the school don't feel safe now. Where do you find that balance where every kid gets to feel fulfilled and safe? The kids who have the things that they need to solve and the kids who don't.
