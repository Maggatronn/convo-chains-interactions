Like, we don't know what's the truth or not because like, just like last week when I was at the hospital, you see peoples outside talking about COVID, it's a hoax and don't get vaccinated. They should have a choice whether to get vaccine or not, especially if it's got to do with their job. If their job is mandatory, that they got to have it. It shouldn't be [inaudible]... against something that they have to have this vaccine in order to keep their job. So where do we go from there? And I think they was wearing a mask. And so this traffic, these new lanes they got going on with these white sticks and given bicycle privileges. I think if they're going to have that, I felt like they need to have the same respect of the road as we do. We have to be licensed. We have to be trained. We had to respect the roles of others and not take an initiative that they can ride those bicycles and not obey the traffic lights, unsafe cars coming. And why do we be penalized if one of them jokers get hit because they was out of bounds? And I just felt like that this whole train trying to get rid of people driving their cars. Everybody's not going to ride a dang gone bike. I'm not going to ride that bike because it's too dangerous out there. I'm already driving a car and I feel a little bit more at ease driving. But right now I don't because you got to be on your A-game because you keep caught the bicycles, they're on the right side of you. And they're on your blind side of you, which is your left side. They're on your left side of you. And on your blind side, which is your right side, depending on which way you're driving on the road and the way that it's making the streets very narrow one-by-one.

So for the household, if it's a household family, two parents in the household, yes, their income is going to escalate, right? And so maybe that one person, one of the members who is the breadwinner, maybe something happens along the way. And then, so they still minimize all the resources they can get they're entitled to because maybe the other member of the household who was the half of the breadwinner still makes too much money because they make over 60, 70,000 a year, right? So because of that, they still not entitled, but they did become minorities. That's complicated. So it's so complicated because who set the barriers of what these words mean? Where it comes from? Where does it resonate from? Mm-hmm (affirmative). So that's what I find such a differ in how you classify Caucasian or white, black, however you want to put it, black, brown, and beige.

Like for instance, everybody knows, well not everybody knows, but it's a common statistic that everyone always talks about, how the average net worth of Black people is $8, versus white people, which is $247,500. That statistic has remained for, I want to say, almost a decade, for years. That's very problematic to me. The reason why it's very gentrification and red-lining in the history of economic inequity to Black people, I hold that very dear to my heart. I don't really talk about this experience a lot, but I've experienced homelessness, when I was in the 3rd or 4th grade. I'm going to read a piece. It's not too long. I wrote this freshman year of high school and it's called ""Home, Bittersweet Home."" This is just a piece. We walked back from school and down the street from our home, we seen a moving truck that took us for a surprise. ""Are we moving?"" My little sister asked. That was our initial thought, but as we got closer and closer to the house, we can hear the distressed crying, screaming voice of my mother, grandparents and neighbors. When we arrived, absolutely everything, all of our belongings were thrown out, broken and laid out all over the front lawn. Strangers were throwing pieces of me out of my home. I watched as they threw my baby pictures in frames from my window room. My favorite baby doll was tossed out and falling to sudden death on the concrete. Cracked TV screens laid out on the lawn, pieces of our bedsets, now were outside with worms and bugs crawling all over it. No bed, meant no place to sleep. The refrigerator laid open on the ground, while flies swarmed all around it. My stomach ached all day from hunger, but no refrigerator, meant no food. No baby pictures, meant no more memories. Now, no house meant no home. I tried to be strong, but emotions flooded my brain and tears burst through the walls of my eyelids. Screams of my mother rang throughout the neighborhood, ""You cannot do this. These are my kids."" With her only belonging left in her hand, her camera, she recorded this whole scene of trauma, along with my grandparents and neighbors, who were also recording and protesting the same. I sobbed while squeezing my sisters and brothers together in a group hug, hoping they wouldn't get to see as much as me. Their tears floods my shirt and weeping cries muffled and echoed upon my chest. Losing everything but the love that we had for each other and with nothing but the clothes on our backs, we returned back to our only shelter that we had now, the car. We did not know where we would go next. We sat in the car waiting for my mom and grandparents to drive off, not knowing where our next stop would be, but definitely knowing it was our last stop here. So that is my experience with homelessness and it's not something I talk about a lot, but that is why this is such a pressing concern, that I hold dear to my heart. Once again, let me repeat the question is, what are we going to do about gentrification? What is the City of Boston doing to close the inequity gap, to stop this economic violence that's been happening to our people? So, that's my question.",Carrie,,*type of highlight.experience,

I wrote this freshman year of high school and it's called ""Home, Bittersweet Home."" This is just a piece. We walked back from school and down the street from our home, we seen a moving truck that took us for a surprise. ""Are we moving?"" My little sister asked. That was our initial thought, but as we got closer and closer to the house, we can hear the distressed crying, screaming voice of my mother, grandparents and neighbors. When we arrived, absolutely everything, all of our belongings were thrown out, broken and laid out all over the front lawn. Strangers were throwing pieces of me out of my home. I watched as they threw my baby pictures in frames from my window room. My favorite baby doll was tossed out and falling to sudden death on the concrete. Cracked TV screens laid out on the lawn, pieces of our bedsets, now were outside with worms and bugs crawling all over it. No bed, meant no place to sleep. The refrigerator laid open on the ground, while flies swarmed all around it. My stomach ached all day from hunger, but no refrigerator, meant no food. No baby pictures, meant no more memories. Now, no house meant no home. I tried to be strong, but emotions flooded my brain and tears burst through the walls of my eyelids. Screams of my mother rang throughout the neighborhood, ""You cannot do this. These are my kids."" With her only belonging left in her hand, her camera, she recorded this whole scene of trauma, along with my grandparents and neighbors, who were also recording and protesting the same. I sobbed while squeezing my sisters and brothers together in a group hug, hoping they wouldn't get to see as much as me. Their tears floods my shirt and weeping cries muffled and echoed upon my chest. Losing everything but the love that we had for each other and with nothing but the clothes on our backs, we returned back to our only shelter that we had now, the car. We did not know where we would go next. We sat in the car waiting for my mom and grandparents to drive off, not knowing where our next stop would be, but definitely knowing it was our last stop here. So that is my experience with homelessness and it's not something I talk about a lot, but that is why this is such a pressing concern, that I hold dear to my heart. Once again, let me repeat the question is, what are we going to do about gentrification? What is the City of Boston doing to close the inequity gap, to stop this economic violence that's been happening to our people? So, that's my question.",Carrie,,*sensitive,

Like for instance, everybody knows, well not everybody knows, but it's a common statistic that everyone always talks about, how the average net worth of Black people is $8, versus white people, which is $247,500. That statistic has remained for, I want to say, almost a decade, for years. That's very problematic to me. The reason why it's very gentrification and red-lining in the history of economic inequity to Black people, I hold that very dear to my heart. I don't really talk about this experience a lot, but I've experienced homelessness, when I was in the 3rd or 4th grade. I'm going to read a piece. It's not too long. I wrote this freshman year of high school and it's called ""Home, Bittersweet Home."" This is just a piece. We walked back from school and down the street from our home, we seen a moving truck that took us for a surprise. ""Are we moving?"" My little sister asked. That was our initial thought, but as we got closer and closer to the house, we can hear the distressed crying, screaming voice of my mother, grandparents and neighbors. When we arrived, absolutely everything, all of our belongings were thrown out, broken and laid out all over the front lawn. Strangers were throwing pieces of me out of my home. I watched as they threw my baby pictures in frames from my window room. My favorite baby doll was tossed out and falling to sudden death on the concrete. Cracked TV screens laid out on the lawn, pieces of our bedsets, now were outside with worms and bugs crawling all over it. No bed, meant no place to sleep. The refrigerator laid open on the ground, while flies swarmed all around it. My stomach ached all day from hunger, but no refrigerator, meant no food. No baby pictures, meant no more memories. Now, no house meant no home. I tried to be strong, but emotions flooded my brain and tears burst through the walls of my eyelids. Screams of my mother rang throughout the neighborhood, ""You cannot do this. These are my kids."" With her only belonging left in her hand, her camera, she recorded this whole scene of trauma, along with my grandparents and neighbors, who were also recording and protesting the same. I sobbed while squeezing my sisters and brothers together in a group hug, hoping they wouldn't get to see as much as me. Their tears floods my shirt and weeping cries muffled and echoed upon my chest. Losing everything but the love that we had for each other and with nothing but the clothes on our backs, we returned back to our only shelter that we had now, the car. We did not know where we would go next. We sat in the car waiting for my mom and grandparents to drive off, not knowing where our next stop would be, but definitely knowing it was our last stop here. So that is my experience with homelessness and it's not something I talk about a lot, but that is why this is such a pressing concern, that I hold dear to my heart. Once again, let me repeat the question is, what are we going to do about gentrification? What is the City of Boston doing to close the inequity gap, to stop this economic violence that's been happening to our people? So, that's my question.",Carrie,,*identity of speaker.gender,

More recently, we've had to and I'll talk about my experience. I've had to continue to book my own shows out of Boston and I mean because the surrounding cities are so much more accepting of, you know what I mean, the types of art that we create. Also, just like the types of artists that we are, whether that's like hip hop, or R & B, or whatever it is, it's also just recognizing the value of young people and the art that we're creating. So I'm doing shows in Worcester, we're doing shows in Cambridge. You know what I mean? Anywhere that's not Boston and it's so weird because, this is where I'm from. This is where I live. This is where I grew up. So I feel like it's definitely tragic, knowing that the people, or like the places, I guess I should say. Not necessarily the people. But the place where I'm from, doesn't necessarily value or accept the art that we're creating, until it's like commodifiable. I feel like that's the key and that's the difficulty. Even like thinking about funding, I know that for me, receiving funding for my art has never necessarily been like an issue, per se. I also know that now it's becoming more of an issue, based on the types of art that I'm willing to create. You know what I mean? So when you seek and you reach out, when you seek funding, you reach out to different foundations, or organizations, you know what I mean, that are like claiming that they put this value on the artist and the creative scene, but then turn around and the art that you're creating isn't necessarily what they're looking for. Or it's like held to kind of like they understand what you're doing, but it's not necessarily what they're looking for, it's not what they want from you. Or it's too explicit, or it's too kind of like your bleeps are shining through a little too much, it becomes a problem. Then they don't necessarily want to fund you anymore. So it's interesting that kind of like that dichotomy there between what you want to create and what they'll almost allow you to create. So it's difficult, for sure. I think as the scene continues to develop and more and more artists continue to work to create and share their voices, it'll be a lot harder to ignore what we have to say.

I don't receive that same reality, if I'm in my community where people look like me. So of course, that's a difference.

You could just see it. It's evident. So that's why I say, it's not really something, people walking and not seeing the difference, is you turning a blind eye to it.

I actually never thought of home-ownership and I'm 66 years old. I hadn't ever thought of it until I'll say probably the past 20 years. And again, I've been in Boston since 1970. And once I graduated high school and college and started working and having children, and I have three adult children and I have three grandchildren as well. And I've just been thinking of it lately because where I live, I live in a complex of 60 town homes, and the management company that works for us, supposedly, they're so unprofessional. They're just so... I would say slumlords if they were our landlords, but I don't call them landlords because they're a management company, but they're the worst. They're so unprofessional. They can't keep a maintenance team together for two seconds. It's just a mess. And I often think, ""If I owned my home or co-owned my home, we wouldn't have to deal with waiting for this or them coming to do this or that."" And I'll admit, I've been a section eight recipient since 1974, 1972 actually, when I moved out from my mom's home. And I've been able to maintain that, thank God, and live in Boston. Of course, the rents are just through the roof, as you all know, but home-ownership, I've been thinking about it lately, Carmen, and I have a son-in-law that he was a vet. I mean, he fought in the army and now he works for the state, and I've just been saying, ""Buy something so that we can co-own. Buy a home or have it built and build me a little, how they call it, the in-law home, or in-law unit next to it or near it. And that way you can receive the rent that I pay, the rent that the state, this year, that they pay as well."" But he's, for some reason, not wanting to do that. But just home-ownership would be so great because you have so much more of a say so in making your home as comfortable as you want it, instead of having to wait and go through the headache of people that aren't doing what they're supposed to do. So I live here right in Dorchester, and I've always thought home-ownership should be out in the suburbs somewhere. But no, I'd love to own a home right here somewhere in Dorchester, because I lived in Dorchester, Mattapan, since I've been in Boston, and I just love it. I don't always love what's going on outside of my door, but I love Dorchester, I really do. And I'd like to own a home here and the homes that they have here just cost so much. I don't foresee that happening, but I'm onboard with you, Carmen. I'd love to be a homeowner. I think we all should be homeowners if we could, but I know that's not...

We need to be secure. And what we get we need to be able to keep it. We need to have something that can't be taken away from us. Like, if we get housing and we buy these houses in the community, I'm concerned about somebody coming in and offering somebody three or four times what their house is worth so that they can blockbust the community.

And I think it was Oanh who said about holding the politicians accountable. And that's not just for the city, that trickles down from way far up there. So we need to hold them all accountable, especially where we live in our communities. They come in our communities, they campaign, and they promise stuff. We don't see the changes. They know what we need. It's not like they don't know what we need. I'll give you a perfect example. Mass Cass. Now, we have this city that is spreading. It's spreading almost like a disease on your skin. You know what I mean? They saw this coming. They've seen it in other cities, and they knew when there was I think 25 tents down there. They saw that. They knew it. They didn't address it. They said they knew there was a problem and they were going to create committees to explore, and they have all these different phrases and things that they use when they want to back you up off of them. So, there's over 200 now. There's a rat infestation there. The community down that way cannot continue to operate. The food pantry is down there. The big food pantry for Boston is down there. It's unsafe. You have people down there who are mentally ill. They're not responsible. So, people seen this coming. I've heard so much [inaudible] about it. Everybody has their take on it but nobody's doing anything about it. Now, and even with the ones that are running for mayor, it comes up in every conversation just about. They knew that it was there. These people didn't just fall off the chicken truck. They have been in the position to do something about that all the time. They have been in political positions, all of them, and especially these two that are running. So they knew. So when Oanh was talking about holding people accountable to their promises, we don't want to just hear you say what we want to hear at the time and get our votes. My vote is very important. I came from the generation where I heard about the stories about them closing down the polls. My mother and my aunts and uncles and all of them, it wasn't safe.

And you listen to each individual person's experience and they share their hearts out and they share important issues that is dear to their hearts or really close to each and every single community. And, that's what motivates them to keep wanting to work with certain political candidates or political leaders, hoping to make a change. Hoping that they can hear our voices, and hoping to see things happen instead of seeing all of that is just like empty promises and the feeling of being used. And I think, at the end of the day that's the feeling that we would hate to have, is the feeling of being manipulated by someone, or being used for their own personal agenda, versus, trying to identify the real problems and coming up with real solutions. And I think that's where we can all relate. Doesn't matter what our background is.

I mean, some of these people that are running have been operating like this for years. So we need to let them know that we pay a salary. You're supposed to represent us. And if you continue to operate like this then we are going to remove you. However, we need everybody. We need the blacks. We need the Latinos. We need the Asian. We need the white folks. We need everybody to be saying the same thing to these elected officials because we get it. We know we don't get the services because we don't come out and vote.

I agree with Soraya about taking her granddaughter to the clinic and stuff and how I really can relate to everyone. And we're just at these moments now, where it's like these are things that we have to be concerned about. Because, I feel like a 12 year old can't even make decisions for themselves, so they shouldn't be able to go into the doctors and be in there by their self. I guess they're trying to do privacy and stuff, but 12 years old, there ain't no privacy. When I was 12, I didn't have no privacy, when I was 12, I couldn't go to the doctors and tell the doctors whatever I wanted to tell them and tell my grandmother to sit out in the waiting room. That wasn't happening. So, I feel like us as parents and grandparents, we have to get back to our roots, because when children were raised the way I was raised, I didn't like being told what to do and stuff and like that, but it made me who I am today and that made me a great person, because I had structure. My grandmother played out with us. We would get in trouble for stuff. Discipline was very popular in our household. And now it's like people are telling the people they can't discipline the children anymore. That's making the kids feel like they've got the power. Growing up I didn't have no power. My grandmother told us something and that was it. And then moving forward to the housing, there's no rent control. Every year my rent is going up and I don't understand that, because it just doesn't make sense to me. The people can just keep raising the rent, raising the rent, housing authorities telling you, ""Oh, there's nothing we can do, we're only going to pay you this amount. Or you're going to have to find somewhere else to live."" And then it's like trying to find somewhere else to live is like pulling teeth out of somebody's head with no Novocaine. It's like my voucher is for this much, people aren't even accepting this price anymore for housing. It's ridiculous. And then as far as the homeless people in the world right now, it's getting cold outside and I really feel for them, because right now it's freezing. And what are we supposed to do. Yes, we're complaining about rent control and housing and stuff. We've got a roof over our head. At the same time, someone else doesn't. And that hurts me, but I still have concerns as a resident also. And as far as April, as far as the people building condos and housing everywhere.

I agree with Soraya about taking her granddaughter to the clinic and stuff and how I really can relate to everyone. And we're just at these moments now, where it's like these are things that we have to be concerned about. Because, I feel like a 12 year old can't even make decisions for themselves, so they shouldn't be able to go into the doctors and be in there by their self. I guess they're trying to do privacy and stuff, but 12 years old, there ain't no privacy. When I was 12, I didn't have no privacy, when I was 12, I couldn't go to the doctors and tell the doctors whatever I wanted to tell them and tell my grandmother to sit out in the waiting room. That wasn't happening. So, I feel like us as parents and grandparents, we have to get back to our roots, because when children were raised the way I was raised, I didn't like being told what to do and stuff and like that, but it made me who I am today and that made me a great person, because I had structure. My grandmother played out with us. We would get in trouble for stuff. Discipline was very popular in our household. And now it's like people are telling the people they can't discipline the children anymore. That's making the kids feel like they've got the power. Growing up I didn't have no power. My grandmother told us something and that was it. And then moving forward to the housing, there's no rent control. Every year my rent is going up and I don't understand that, because it just doesn't make sense to me. The people can just keep raising the rent, raising the rent, housing authorities telling you, ""Oh, there's nothing we can do, we're only going to pay you this amount. Or you're going to have to find somewhere else to live."" And then it's like trying to find somewhere else to live is like pulling teeth out of somebody's head with no Novocaine. It's like my voucher is for this much, people aren't even accepting this price anymore for housing. It's ridiculous. And then as far as the homeless people in the world right now, it's getting cold outside and I really feel for them, because right now it's freezing. And what are we supposed to do. Yes, we're complaining about rent control and housing and stuff. We've got a roof over our head. At the same time, someone else doesn't. And that hurts me, but I still have concerns as a resident also. And as far as April, as far as the people building condos and housing everywhere.

I feel like we all can relate to each other's questions and concerns as we've all experienced it at some point in life. And it's complicated like someone said, the world is so divided, but at the same time, we do need to be more, I agree with being more involved in the kids' schools because you don't know what's going on over there. My son is five years old and I went to the school. They had a meeting with me, because he has autism. He was pulling his pants down and urinating on the floor. So, I'm like, ""Okay, that doesn't sound right, because when he's at home he is not doing it, he goes to the bathroom and he wears underwear."" So, for school I didn't feel comfortable just putting him out in school in underwear so I sent him in pull ups. And they were all like, ""He needs to be in underwear since he wears underwear at home, he should be in underwear at school."" I was like, ""I don't think that's a good idea."" Because, I think it's too fast. He is not familiar with his surroundings yet, he doesn't know. But people don't think that we know our children and that we don't know what's best for them, because they have degrees and these things and that they know better than we do, but if we've been with our children ever since they've been born. We know our child more than anyone else can think that they know them. So, I did what they said and I put him in underwear and I sent him to the school. And I set my son up for failure, because then he's in an uncomfortable situation. He doesn't know if this is comfortable for him or not. So, he ended up pulling his pants down and stuff. So, then they ended up wanting to have a meeting with me. So, I ended up having the meeting with them. And then I'm like, ""Let me see what this bathroom looks like, let me see."" Because, my son has a problem with using public restroom, so I go in the bathroom and I walk into the classroom and the classroom is so depressing. As soon as I went in the class, it was a whole depression came over me or something. It was dark in the class. I forgot where I was at. And I'm like, ""Damn, open up some of the windows, the shades and stuff, why is it so dark in here?"" And so I walked into the bathroom to see if he'll go and the bathroom was so dark and scary. It looked like it was a dungeon or something. I'm like, ""No wonder why these kids is in here acting up, they're in a developmental class and it's depressing as hell in here. Come on. No wonder why they're acting up. Open up the damn shades. Put the light on in the bathroom. God said let there be light, come on. Get it together in here."" I'm like, ""Oh my god, I didn't even know."" I felt something as soon as I went in there and I was uncomfortable. And I didn't like that so I took my son home for the day, because as soon as I went back in the room to talk with the teacher and then they said my son was knocking shelves off of the wall. So, I'm like, ""Yeah, you're going home for the rest of the day."" They were trying to kick him out of school. So now guess what, since I put the pull ups back on and send him to school, now it's okay for him to stay at the school. I don't know. Thank you. I don't know.",Janet,,*type of highlight.links,

No wonder why they're acting up. Open up the damn shades. Put the light on in the bathroom. God said let there be light, come on. Get it together in here."" I'm like, ""Oh my god, I didn't even know."" I felt something as soon as I went in there and I was uncomfortable. And I didn't like that so I took my son home for the day, because as soon as I went back in the room to talk with the teacher and then they said my son was knocking shelves off of the wall.

But me, I live in Braintree. And I have to know everyone that's around me, because I'm paranoid. I have to know you, I have to know what you're about, I have to see you. I speak, ""Hey, how are you doing?"" I lived down here for quite a while, since 2009. And I know everybody in my building. I know everybody in a couple of buildings, because I moved to a couple of different buildings, but I still wouldn't and say, ""Hey, do you mind watching my kid for me?"" We try to- Janet, you're on mute again. Control over everything. We don't have control over everything. So that's how I feel.

There was a person from Methadone Mile, a homeless person, that was at my car at each one of those stops. So it was a very scary thing to go through and I don't wish that on anybody because I was really nervous. And then I saw a security guard come around and get them off from around the McDonald's and the area. But it's a very scary experience, but it's a reality that those people are living every day and I think that there should be more done to be able to get those people off the street and the mental health that they need.",Pamela,,housing.housing instability,

But we don't see that happen now. What we see is the people who claim everything and the poor doesn't have opportunity to glean behind them. And so when people go to harvest, what I'm saying is that they leave something for the poor. And what we're seeing is that the rich, [inaudible] goes grab everything is that's there.

I think it's Pamela that was talking about housing and how she grew up here and over the years has seen a transformation, or what we would call gentrification now. And I think it's a real need. I wasn't born here, so I don't know anything about that, but I have read so much to understand that it's a reality. And so, having spent the last, like I said, spent the last 13 years now, in Boston, I think I could, to a large extent, say I have seen it, but also I have listened to many stories. It resonates with me and I think too, to that point, is that having conversations like this and making sure that folks like Pamela, and many others who have lived here, do not leave here to go to Brockton or go to another place, it's real. And so we need to fight together. It is, whether you are new to Boston or just coming to Boston yesterday, or even arrive in Boston today, the conversation should be ongoing. I think too, and then to Kelly's point with the mental crisis, anytime I drive past the Methadone Miles I weep for this country. One, I know I'm a Nigerian, so in case you're wondering who did this, so keep talking, and I've traveled around the world to know when I see [inaudible], it baffles me that we live in a country with so much abundance and yet people are dying. It's... I just can't understand what's happening, but yet it feels like this happened in my country. It's going to be all over the world that Nigeria is blah, blah, blah. All of those African countries are black, but yet if I could take pictures and show it to my folks in Nigeria, they will laugh at me. But anyway, that's a different conversation. So I say that this is a reality, and we have to do that together, irrespective of where we come from. Whether you're old or new, it's a fight that we have to do and I think, like I said, I'm also coming from a spiritual... Today's kind of a day that the Lord has made. But I remember this, just this in regards to the Old Testament, sorry, I'm going to go a little bit fate, where the Bible talks about even those that are poor, the rich, when they go to glean their land, the Bible tells us that they allow, they don't glean everything, they allow for the poor. But we don't see that happen now. What we see is the people who claim everything and the poor doesn't have opportunity to glean behind them. And so when people go to harvest, what I'm saying is that they leave something for the poor. And what we're seeing is that the rich, [inaudible] goes grab everything is that's there. They grab as much as they could. They could even clear everything so the poor doesn't have anything on the street. And that's the result of what we see happen here. And so that's one story that resonates with me. And, like I said, I'm here. Part of the rules, it goes to tie to my own passion of seeing young people, that they don't have to live like their parents. I've got two boys and this is a fight that I have to do for them.

So I was reading that and I was learning about different inter relations in the sociopolitical context of living here. And I was thinking a lot about inequality, which is definitely highlighted there. And then I was reading lots of articles about Boston and the issues people were facing. And I wanted to know about my specific area, I was moving into this Brighton and Allston area. And I guess what my role would be and what my place would be moving in here? I was reading a lot about gentrification and how these colleges and universities that are here are causing a lot of the problem, because people get big jobs with big salaries and then they stay here and then they cause the cost of rentals to rise. And also, just there's so many students, so the demand is so high. And yeah, all these issues. But for me, my sister, I'm from Pennsylvania, so she lives by Philadelphia and for a very nice new, renovated apartment, Philadelphia is not cheap. I don't know, the prices aren't even comparable to like a little apartment here in Brighton, which is just interesting. And I think that for some, while at the same time, as some colleges and universities, they're causing these issues. But I think that students can afford to live in these situations and pay the prices and that's causing the costs to rise. But I feel like with my PhD stipend, it's very low. And I'm from a low SES family. And my parents can't afford to help me, which I know is happening for some other students in my program. So it's definitely really a struggle just to make ends meet and meet my rent. And when I was choosing programs and comparing them, I was talking to people who live here for a while, like the faculty and students and things like that. And a big thing they said was, ""We can't change it, but this stipend is really hard to live on, especially with the cost of living in Boston, how high it is.

Por mi experiencia, yo tengo 20 años viviendo en Boston y en los últimos años para mí ha sido un esfuerzo sobrehumano pagar la renta.

w/Mayra Molina","Yo me conecte con Mayra Molina. ¿Por qué me conecte con Mayra Molina? Porque ella habló de las áreas verdes, automáticamente estamos deforestando, porque si estamos deshaciéndonos de las áreas verdes para construir edificios, entonces estos calores que nos estaba dando la vez pasada en parte es a raíz de esto. ¿Por qué le digo esto? Porque yo tengo experiencia, yo soy de Honduras, en Honduras hay mucha deforestación, por eso los calores son intensos, horribles en Honduras, porque la gente corta los árboles para sacar madera, y luego no siembran otro árbol para atrás; y eso es una de las causas. Cuando nosotros escuchamos de este problema climático, nosotros lo repetimos, se vuelve algo repetitivo, pero no nos centramos a pensar cuáles son las causas de estos calores que nos están atacando a nosotros. Y entonces, en el futuro, ¿qué va a pasar con el futuro? Nosotros ya estamos viendo en otros estados las quemas, los fuegos en California y en todos estos lados, es a causa de todas estas situaciones.
