East Boston was always cheap, and poor, and even though I didn't have any money I could have easily bought a house anywhere around me. Now when I retire, which, who knows when that's going to be? Well, I'll be stretching myself, with a pension with two people who worked their whole life to get about 900 square foot, maybe 800 square foot condo for about $650,000,000. This is absurd. No yard. That's the bottom line for a two bedroom condo in East Boston. If I could to other city neighborhood, which I'm not interested in, I'm going to be in the same boat. West Roxbury believe it or not is way cheaper, a nice big condo, but that's a long ways to go. My grandchildren are all there, my daughter is there.

I have to go out to Lexington, Wakefield, Stoneham, just to bring her to a park that I'm comfortable letting her play in, because of the needles that I found at one park, the condoms that I found at one park. There is not a space for us to be in right now. There is just not a space. Not even COVID, just in general. I used to be able to walk from my house to Carson Beach, or to Castle Island, or to Tufts Medical Center, and just have a great walk.

When I first moved here most of the apartments were under 900 for splitting a four bedroom with three other roommates. Now less than 25% of them are. I used to think that I would live here for a long time, and now I don\\'t. It gets even harder as someone who has a disability and need to find a flexile apartment. I also think about, I work with a lot of disabled people in the Boston area, and for so many of them, when people ask me, \"How do I find an accessible apartment?\" I\\'m having trouble. And I expect so little to offer them. I think about one of our members when I first started, who is an amazing advocate. She almost single handedly got the T station near her house to be completely renovated, and prioritized, and made accessible. I was visiting her, and she offered me a cup of tea in her apartment. I took her up on it, and she was like, \"Great, and you\\'re going to have to make the tea, because I can\\'t get into my kitchen, because it\\'s not wide enough for my wheelchair.\" When halfway through our visit I asked if I could use the bathroom, and she was like, \"Yeah, I\\'ll stay over here, because they had to take the door off, because I couldn\\'t get my wheelchair into the bathroom with the door on.\" This is an apartment that she found after looking for at least a year, and this is the best she could get.

What I will say is is that there is something that is engraved in the fabric of Boston from the hallowed halls of Faneuil Hall, where they did the trading years ago, where we all sit and have a meal together now that folks don't really speak about. I was at a job that I loved for almost five years, and because I don't go to places to change things, I went there to be a good fit. I was a counselor in the human services field. I'll speed this up, but I wrote an email, because they offered the COVID vaccine to the families of the employees except for two persons of color, myself and someone else. I spoke up about that, and in the email I wrote that the company was no stranger to systemic racism, and because I used those two words, they found two reasons to get rid of me. They said, my paperwork wasn't at the par, and that I was late a few times. After I sent the email they responded eight days later to my email. People didn't speak to me around the office. They were afraid to have conversations with me after I used those two words. And I had just been given a raise, a $3 raise by the way. And I had just been given that raise retroactively a whole year back for my performance, but yet I was fired for not having good performance. That's why when you made that statement about what people hold so dear about Boston, I spent every day working for that organization, helping other people to try to get their lives on track. And in a moment after sending that email off, my whole life was turned upside down, and I lost a lot. I just had my credit on track, I was thinking of purchasing a home, so I can move out of the punch that that I live in. And because of the loss of a job the credit score went down, everything just in one moment. The racism piece, trying to cover it up caused me to lose a whole lot. Thank you for sharing what you said.

       "  'words': 'Eviva, I am so glad you stuck up for your coworker, because as Jo-Ann said, it happened to me, but it happened to me in 2013. I was thankful that I did have coworkers that wrote letters for me, but I was fired. I had a boss that literally would harass me. I would be on the phone, and she would come ... You can tell now, but I have a lot of hair. She would come, and touch my shoulder, and turn me around, and was like, \"Did you hear what I said?\" I\\'m like, \"I\\'m on the phone with a provider. Give me a second.\" She would scream at me, and yell at me, and berate me. I did end up suing the company. I can\\'t disclose anything, but I ended up having to, because they fired me. I couldn\\'t believe it, because I was there for three years, and I was really good at my job, but she didn\\'t have any training. A lot of times, instead of hiring another person of color within the company that was really, really good, because there was somebody that was just as good, they hired outside, and the person wasn\\'t even ... She wasn\\'t trained to be a director, because we had to report directly to the director. It was a very horrible experience to the point where I left corporate completely. I had to go to therapy for a while, because I never experienced that. I went to a predominantly white school system. I didn\\'t experience it there. I never experienced it until I got into the workspace, and I haven\\'t been back. So, I am trying to get back in now, but with kid gloves, because I guess I\\'m stronger now to deal with it. I wasn\\'t mentally strong at the time. My mother had passed away a few years before that, so I just wasn\\'t prepared to deal with her, and it was a bad experience. So, I completely commend you, because I did have coworkers that did stick up for me, and write letters, and stuff. But they weren\\'t strong enough to say something to her face, but they were willing to write letters when I had to go to court, and stuff. I\\'m glad you did. So thank you for that.',\n",

But the cost of living in Boston has gone up tremendously, especially in the last two years alone. And it is becoming more difficult for single mid adult age and young adult age youth to become more independent and have more opportunities for getting an apartment they can afford. A lot of my peers are in the bracket where they make too much to be on housing or have a subsidy, but they don't make enough to pay market rent.

And 19 of the 30 kids were from Boston public high schools. And it was in 1975, 76, 77. So it was right after school desegregation and the city was going coocoo. And I did not understand why everybody was so mad that people that look like all of you on the call wanted what I already had when we all pay taxes and public education is supposed to be free for everybody? So anyway, I spent the next 15 years trying to understand that and study it. And I have come to understand that most people who are leaders in our nation don't know the history of structural racism. So my question is probably, what are you going to understand the history of structural racism and how it impacts us today and what you're going to do about it? Drop the mic. So now I'm going to read to you what we were supposed to do the last time, because this is only my first time doing the conversation. The resonance is supposed to be with an individual. What I want you to do next is think back to each of the questions. We did two, so it could be either one and their experiences that were just shared in the group. And then find someone whose question or experiences resonates with your own life. Then I want you to speak to that person and tell them why their question or experience resonated with you and share a story from your life that connects with their experience. So I'm going to give everybody a minute to do that. And actually the last conversation we had so much in common that we didn't say specifically. So this is an upgrade, especially for those who will be doing conversations because we're assuming there'll be people that have different questions and come from different walks of life. And we really want the opportunity for people in these conversations to share directly with somebody else and make that personal connection. So who would like to go first? Take a minute to think, and then you can just put your hand up or unmute yourself. And I'm going to stop for a minute.\",\n",

       "  'words': \"What I wanted to say the question that resonated with me is ironically yours, Fran, because I grew up in Mission Hill during the busing era. I moved here after living in Grove Hall and I came to shell shock because over there I had Black neighbors like myself and then I came here and it was primarily white. My first experience was going up to the playground in Mission Hill and having a white kid punched me in the face, no reason at all. And then our first encounter was my sister having to beat him up. And then in the fall, turns out that he's in my class. And so this is the beginning of my life as a middle schooler, listening to the stories of the high school and them having race wars and us fighting with our friends who were friends in school but as soon as we crossed the street from the Catholic middle school that we went to, then it was all hell that broke out. And so I became an activist when I was 14, very young. And probably at that time subconsciously leading to my adult life as an activist, I never did anything in Mission Hill. I never wanted to have anything to do with this area, but sleeping. And so I think that probably about three or four years ago, I joined the board of our neighborhood bus but before that, I still had a lot of that animosity. So the systemic racism that exists now as the community and cultural engagement manager at Mass General hospital, I'm doing my best to break down a lot of those walls and having to fight with white people to get them to see why this is not a handout or a hand up, but it's just telling them that they as a system need to give back to a community that they've turned their back on for so many years.\",\n",

       "  'words': \"I like to say that it all really touched home with me what everyone's saying, especially the last three. And I could pull from my history something applicable. So I think I might honor all three and say a little bit about all. In terms of Cindy's experience with racism, growing up, I remember walking home from Boston Bowl and this is on the east side of Washington. And it was four of us. We were all Black from the west side of Washington and the only way to get to Boston Bowl was walk. And we got jumped on our way coming back from bowling and car of young white men, young white boys jumped out and started to swing at us with golf clubs. I remember getting hit at my chest and the club breaking off. And ironically, how we got out of that, a vehicle stopped with an interracial couple. And then the neighbors who saw who were all white, came down to help us because they didn't feel what was happening was right which is true. And so that really tainted my view on some of the race issues, because at around the same time we were being bused as well, from Dorchester to, I was bused from Dorchester to West Roxbury- the Joyce Kilmer. So that touched my life. And then something else that really resonated with me too that's worthy of calling out is the issues that this country, the world is facing with climate change. And it's a real thing. And Boston, like this storm coming the T-stop in the South Bay has to be four to five, so that the station wouldn't get a flood with the anticipated storm coming. So it is real. There'll be more storms like this. And I'm working to get the word around about climate change. And then the third aspect is the mental health issues and challenges that we as a community face. They really overlap with a lot of the different things that we are concerned about at this table right now. And if we can see the connection, you can see how important it is to act today. With mental health, we don't really see it as a job issue, but it really is because when lives are stable and incomes are comparable to the national average, lives are better and the stress is less and you don't look for self-medication and you treat your kids better. So the quality of life all the way around where all of these things seem seemingly not connected are very interwoven like a sweater. So we have to really take a mindset of all the challenges that we have.\",\n",

Sometimes it\\'s not just about weapons. I\\'m going to get a little bit intimate here and share something that happened to me recently. Last winter, I was in crisis and I had lost my phone. Well, actually my phone had broke and then I had lost it. It was raining really bad that day. And I went into crisis and I was looking for a phone to use. I was near a friend\\'s house. So I said, let me walk to this friend\\'s house because usually they are at home, maybe I can use their phone and get a ride back to my house or whatever I got to do. So I was on my way to the friend\\'s house and I saw the friend in that area. So I didn\\'t even make it to their house. And I was asking them, \"Oh hey, my phone got wet in the rain. I don\\'t have a bus pass. I need to call a ride. Can I use your phone?\" And they was like, \"Oh, my phone\\'s off. I\\'m going to go pay my bill now.\" So I was going to go with them to pay their bill. So I asked, \"Can I just walk with you or whatever?\" And they act like they didn\\'t know me. So that led me to go to wait for them at their house. They said, I could wait for them at their house because they didn\\'t know how long it was going to take. So I got a little antsy. So I knocked on a neighbor\\'s door and they opened the door and I asked them, I said, \"Hey, I need some help. I just need to use a phone. I\\'m a friend of your neighbors.\" And I\\'ve seen them before and they\\'ve seen me before and they just started attacking. So you can imagine how strange that was. It was a very serious altercation. It was more than one person attacking me. Someone called the ambulance because I was obviously beaten up and I had to go to Boston Medical and mind you, I still had no phone. And my family started worrying about me. They had to put a missing persons report because remember I had no phone, I wasn\\'t home. And I was never able to use someone else\\'s phone. And it bothered me that when somebody could be needing help or something and they knock on your door and the first thing you do is attack them, you don\\'t try to give, you know what I mean, help them out and see if there\\'s anything, if they need to use a phone or if you could show them where the ... just help out instead of ... like, the first instinct was for these people to attack me. Why? I don\\'t know.',\n",

And on top of that, I was really injured. I had to have MRIs and brain scans and stuff like that because I was disoriented at that point because of the blows to the head. And so I feel like a lot of this violence that does happen goes back into mental health. A lot of people have mental health issues and they're not dealing with them. A lot of people have been traumatized. Maybe that person has an old trauma about someone coming to their door and that's why they responded that way. Or even just being trauma informed can ... even people who don't want to admit they've been traumatized or anything, or if they actually weren't, but being trauma informed will allow us to be more considerate of the people around us and to be more gentle and be more kind and understand that everyone goes through different periods of their life where you might lose someone and that can put you in grief and there's trauma support for that.

All their childhood experiences, it's a lot of traumatic stories and trauma related to their first five years of life. So that's where it prompted me to have the question of, why can't we make it a child-orientated world instead of an adult-orientated world? So that's where I started to ponder on that question.

At the age of nine, I remember vividly going to Cub Scout every Wednesday, being spit on by white boys, drunken white boys who were bigger than me ... I was nine years old ... teenage white boys. And they would spit on me, drunk, and I would have to go into Cub Scout smelling of liquor and spit. I can still smell the liquor. One of the opening songs we were saying is my country ... Or recite, \"My country, \\'tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty,\" but I didn\\'t feel very free. Fast forward, as the executive director of the community center I used to go to as a child, as the assistant director going into the director, I was initiated with the child steward tragedy in 1989 in October. I can remember the date and time, seeing black men being strip-searched, civil rights savagely violated. I\\'m being the director and I had to turn around because I didn\\'t want to be subjected to it. These were my friends. These were my participants in the community center, people that grew up with me, family members. Actually, my cousin, who was a former city councilor, was one of the kids. I skipped over something very important because I know that education is pointing ... And this has been in the news. One of the most prominent high schools in the city of Boston throughout the country, the first public school ... In the seventh grade, I was accepted in Boston Latin. I did not want to go there, but my mother made me go there. But during my tenure there in the seventh grade, I was called the N-word by a teacher. So I continued to fight for the freedom, the liberation of black boys and black men. I have a 21-year-old son. Every time I look at the news, I\\'m afraid of the young people I\\'ve helped, the brothers I see. When I opened up, I said I\\'m emotionally, spiritually in that zone, trying to deal with life. I lost a friend, I\\'m speaking at his funeral tomorrow, who happens to be connected to an elected official, our mayor. I fought to help black men with an effort to form a commission that was denied. That\\'s my story.',\n",

Meet them where they're at, grab their hand and just go from there. There should be no poverty. There should be no hunger in the most richest country on earth in America. With Ron, that being the racism, I'm blacker than Ron, I think. I don't know how ... You aren't going to compete shades. You know what I'm saying? But I've experienced racism in a lot of things of that nature. But if you honor each person, whether they're Chinese, they're black, they're Asian, white, whatever, you start teaching this in school, child honoring. It's called child honoring. You teach it in school. As they grow up, they'll learn, regardless of their parents' ideology about different races, they'll respect and honor that human being and work with that human being. Diversity is our strength. So my story does connect with all of them. Right now, we're in a culture of just extreme anger, entitlement, violence, anger violence, gun violence, drug, pandemic. All these pandemics and this culture, it's crazy. So let me just focus on the children, making the best for the children, what's right for the children and keeping them happy and giving them the best childhood that they could possibly have imagined. That's all I got, bro.\",\n",

It was in 1976 when I started at Latin and I remember how during busing, the Boston Latin and Boston English, Boston Latin where I was a student, predominantly white Boston English, where all my friends were mostly at, predominantly black. There were times that folks, whoever would pull the fire alarm and the white kids and the black kids, 1976, I would come out and it would be a riot. I would have to go back into a school full of white kids that fought my friends. So the busing ever ... We've talked about racism, we've talked about our experiences and our story, but that just brought me back and it was a trigger for me because you can't put a bandaid on racism because it's like putting salt in the wound. It festers. I'm feeling this now. Jamal, my mother was a foster parent and she probably had about 30 young children that called her mother. I had a whole bunch of mothers, bro, [inaudible]. She made the best fried chicken in the world and I got a recipe now. But to see you as a father, with the stereotype of black men, I see it right here. You have two beautiful daughters. I see that. Right? And when they say black men left their families, there were no father figures for you, but there, you're doing something special. You're doing something that a lot of black men do.

It marginalized people of color, it marginalized women, marginalized LGBTQ, all that youth. And I think education is a source of all opportunity and all growth and all wealth. So I speak from my experience, because I had the opportunity to sit in a meeting with Arne Duncan, who is the former Secretary of Education. And this was a meeting where students from all across the country, we sat down, we talked with him. And we just got to talk, what is our education system looking like? And I\\'m from Boston, Harvard\\'s down the sheet, Wentworth, MIT, all these schools. But in my mind, and I\\'m actually talking with the kids that I work with now, they\\'re juniors and seniors [inaudible] O\\' Bryant School. And they\\'re like, they read these books that like, \"The next day, we don\\'t remember what we read.\" And it\\'s interesting because I think that when I actually talked with Arnie Duncan, I told him straight up, I was like, \"You look like you\\'re really outstanding man. So why is it that we don\\'t have classes on financing? Why can\\'t we teach cooking class? Why can we teach home economic classes? Why can we not teach our youth how to make a garden? How to cook for yourself? How to buy a car? How to do these things? Why does our family members have to do this on our own and teach and teach us when.\" I feel it makes sense in education system, we should be learning that specific fact. I mean, the weather cycle is great and all, but teach the foundations of life first and then you can proceed to electives as in like, language and... I mean, language is of course important but teach stuff on first. And it\\'s interesting because I think that that\\'s something education is once we\\'re going to do it, you have to be a public school, or a private school, or a charter school to start your own curriculum. But I think that it\\'s important to start teaching, especially Black and Brown youth, we shouldn\\'t wait until you\\'re in your 20s to start learning about finance. And it\\'s unfortunate that these kids we had to learn on our own, how to do all of it. It\\'s just not right.',\n",

And I feel we see a lot of buildings and affordable housing units and all these things being pop up, but the demand for is still not being met. So my personal experience is I entered the lottery for one of these new buildings, and the lotteries through the city, but then once you get accepted, it then gets pushed to the property management company. And the property management companies have tactics in place to deter folks from actually being placed within those units. So what accountability measures are being placed for a program that\\'s being funded by the taxpayers, that\\'s being built by the city, and all these different things, and it\\'s just like the ball is passed to folks that are not managing it appropriately. And in a space where there\\'s a lot of just disorganization, and they\\'re not being honest about things. And they\\'re saying, \"Oh, this person\\'s rejecting it, and not creating a full picture.\" We\\'re never going to be able to meet the demand. If the folks that you were doing business with, you\\'re not making it clear to them that this is your expectation. And if you don\\'t meet the expectation, the result is you will no longer have a contract as a property management company. And I feel just all around, there\\'s just no accountability period for anyone. Folks just get to do what they want to do, they put a really great picture on, they write eloquent words, they create this whole pie chart and graphs without actually implementing any other measures or showing all the progress that was made. And no one goes back and says, \"Well, we know we want to be able to audit your paperwork, we want to be able to see what it is that you\\'re doing. We want to have conversations with folks that you\\'ve had contact with to understand what customer service has been? What process has there been? Has it been transparent? What\\'s happening? And so as we\\'re working to build more spaces and build more housing for folks, I would really love to see this city or the next mayor really have a handle on what is actually happening. And I know that the mayor, she or he cannot do everything by themselves, but they also have to make sure that the folks that they\\'re appointing around them has the capacity and the ability to really go forth and prioritize this.',\n",

Just because somebody was able to afford a education doesn't mean that they have knowledge and understanding or understand the population that they're dealing with. So I couldn't get those high paying jobs, because didn't had a education, but I had the experience, you know what I mean? So it goes all the way back to the affordable housing, I would be content, if I didn't have to raise my child and make sure he was equipped. If I didn't have to work two jobs, it's hard trying to juggle school work and your child, you know what I mean? So, I think we need to bring back affordable housing which is really affordable to middle class people, working people because when you are working, in my experience, you can't get certain benefits, you can't get TAFDC, you can't get food stamps, snap as you all call it benefits anymore, because you are overqualified. You have to qualify first before you can get this snap. And so stuff like that helps and it benefits your child. But the working class, if we make over a certain amount, we can get that affordable housing, quote, unquote, we can get the support that other families can get. And people that, basically, I'm not going to say we don't need it. But what I'm saying is, we all need it. We all need support. We all need a hand. So, don't look at my income and say that it's less than somebody else that has lower income. My needs is the same as that other person. So if my needs are not being met, right? How can I afford it? So their needs is not being met by this programming to help them meet those needs. But there's no programming for us middle class. So my question is, when are we going to have affordable housing? So women, single moms don't have to work two and three jobs just to make ends meet.\",\n",

       "  'words': 'I\\'m going to add to the idea. I think Debra and [inaudible 00:3 7:05]talked about the housing. I think that\\'s the most important thing. And as a parent, when you talked about juggling work, school, and raising kids. That\\'s something that not a lot of people that I know are... They don\\'t have that knowledge of how to balance all of that together and also get a house. Usually, I mean, people in my generation, or at least or friends or my circle, they\\'re just getting housing and trying to... If you scroll on Instagram, Facebook, it\\'s like, \"Okay, who has the latest job? Who has the latest features or car?\" But our parents weren\\'t worried about that, they were worried about is this the house I want? Is this is this rent good? I remember, my family was moving from... Obviously, when I was growing up, I didn\\'t care where I lived, it was whatever it was good enough for me. But we moved from our apartment to a house. And that in and of itself, was the greatest thing for my family. It\\'s now we have a house. And the idea of home ownership. I don\\'t think people in the inner city understand that. You can literally, if you are a good parent, you can be looking at your children, and they won\\'t see the suburbs or the rural areas and be like, \"I want that.\" Though we see on TV, and understand that that\\'s the life, but they won\\'t look up to you and be like, \"We need to have a house.\" But you are thinking, \"We need a house. This is what I want. I want to create generational wealth.\" And that\\'s something that I think people in my circle didn\\'t grow up with that idea. It was just everything\\'s here, we have an apartment, we have our household, we have education. But the idea of now getting affordable housing is something that is coming to the forefront of my mind. And how do you make sense of getting affordable housing? Where\\'s the right place to do it? And thinking about not just getting a house but if you want to have a family, how do you now choose the right location for a school. How do you choose it, where you have good hospitals near you? And I think it\\'s something that goes back to education, not just finances, though we need to understand how does housing happen? How do you make sure someone is held accountable if they\\'re not hiring their friends to get this in the housing? How do you make sure everything connects and fits. And that\\'s why I take it back to education, because if we\\'re not just learning about 400 years of history, or the weather cyber, which is sometimes... It\\'s important, but if we all are at the same understanding of what is going on our society, and I think you\\'ve talked about civic engagement. Voting, we don\\'t talk about that in school at all. And it doesn\\'t make any sense because there are so... You\\'ll see signs of this mayor, this person for councilor, it\\'s like, \"Who is this person?\" We\\'re seeing these people every single day, but you don\\'t understand your role. And I think it\\'s also how to not only accountability for people who are in places in power, but how do we take accountability for ourselves, because we are citizens who have so much power. We have the power to vote, but not only that, we have the power to learn and make active change, to create community spaces, sit down and do it. But how do we understand our role? And it\\'s because we\\'re not taught at all. We\\'re not taught that we have one. And we need to know that we do have one.',\n",

       "  'words': 'Thank you for that. For me, Miss Debra, your story resonated with me when it comes to banking and loans and financing. So when I was growing up, when we first came to America from Haiti, my parents, we lived in Everett. And so I went to the Everett school systems. And once you get to high school, there was actually... Everett Cooperative Bank is within the high school. And that was a class that you take. And I took the class for two years. And so you go through the class, they teach you everything about banking, you actually do banking within the schools, kids have accounts and all that, once you graduate, they then position you into the actual branch outside, where you now have a job as you graduate, and you\\'re going through the whole banking system. And so that\\'s something that since in Boston, I\\'ve been trying to figure out every corner you turn around, there\\'s a bank, somewhere, but I don\\'t see that being implemented at all. And a big question for me is that we\\'ve been talking about entrepreneurs and businesses and loans, but there hasn\\'t been any discussions on personal. You\\'re building these homes, you\\'re building these spaces, we can\\'t afford them because we can\\'t get loans. So where\\'s the disconnect? Where are the conversations that are being had to know that everything is interconnected? So if you want us to be able to access the generational wealth, typically, in order for us to access it, we need to get a loan in order for us to make that purchase. And we know that through the banking system, it\\'s very predatory practices, it\\'s just absolute. Structural racism within the banking system is just out of this world. And I think that that\\'s one of the ways that we need to make sure that we can start to attack some of the challenges and issues that we\\'re having in our communities, you see more check cashing places than you actually see banks. And then the banks that are opened, there\\'s no sense of community, you can\\'t go in there, there\\'s no one that really knows your name, no one\\'s actually sitting there to try to figure out what they can screen you for, what products they have that would work for you. It\\'s just taking your money and then not investing into any of the programming around you. And investing in anything that\\'s beneficial for you. But meanwhile, you\\'re giving them your hard earned funds constantly. And that\\'s something that I would really love to see an elected, at least try to acknowledge or convene the banking systems in all the different places that we have, to start to have conversations on how do they better approach people of color, and making sure that the products that they have available work for us, and if our credit scores are not good enough, or we\\'re not meeting the requirements, what programs do you have in place to help us get there? How can you usher us into a new space where we can walk into your space, and be able to say, \"I\\'d like a loan, please.\" Actually, we don\\'t even need to be able to ask for a loan, you should be coming to us because you go everywhere else, and you send fliers to X, Y and Z and you say, \"You\\'re pre approved for this amount of money.\" But how do we improve that line of communication and the ability for us to feel we can go to banks and be able to access the funds like we know a lot of other people can.',\n",

At what point do we take our power and our choice back to ensure that the systems that we know are here actually start to work for us? We are living in a digital age now where we have access to YouTube and articles and all these other things. And so how much are we taking advantage of these critical information to help us to frame our understanding of what's happening in our communities? And so we are under 400 years of oppression where it's a constant catch up, and we haven't had an opportunity to once just usher into a space where we can finally be, but at the same time, in reverence and honor to our ancestors and folks that came before us, the tireless work that they've put out before us and becoming the first and dismantling here, mantling that, when do we take that back and prioritize it and put it at the very forefront? Because when desegregation occurred, it wasn't for us, it was to access our money. Because they knew that within a Black community, we are one of the biggest spenders. So what we had is never going to be equal because it wasn't with the intention of creating this for us to thrive and be, it was created just to give us a glimpse and make us feel we're a part when we're not. Our money is a part, our money is counted. But when it comes to proper education, and housing, and healthcare and everything else that other folks have lighter skin tones have an opportunity and access to, we are denied that. And so it's just important for us to recognize what has been put up against us and figure out how do we call forth those same spirits and power that was bestowed upon us to continue to deconstruct and really abolish this nasty system that's built off of genocide, basically.\",\n",

Maybe they were sponsored by their government, and they were well-trained. But I worked with them in computer schools, and a lot of them, they have a lot of skills. Yeah, I say to myself, thinking that if I can put together a computer network, physical computer network, and have a nonprofit organization, I might invite in US citizens that are striving to develop their skills in the IT department, and come in and work at it to try to gain those skills, because the knowledge they're getting in colleges, like the community college, I guess isn't enough. You're not allowed to take the computers apart, work with it, experiment. They only let you do a certain level of configuration, but that's it. When you go out into the real world, it's a lot different. It's a lot, lot different. You won't understand Excel. Okay, I've got two certificates from Excel at a really good IT school, and in Excel, they got us to do a couple of links to a couple of pages, do a couple of formulas, and that was about it, where you can go in and enter the information in this page, and the information will appear in the next page. You might type a form in MS Word, and then embed the information from Excel to that Word form, and that was it. I mean, it looked great. It was fantastic to learn it. But when I got into the work environment and I got handed a Excel document, it's a good thing I was strong with Excel, because that Excel document had about 500 different lines that I had to go through looking to do that entry and the make sure that there was no mistakes in the other part of the balance sheet, another page on the Excel. And if it did, I had to find where the mistake was. That was a big difference. In the community college, it was just two links to two pages, but in the real world, it was a huge [crosstalk]. Okay. Okay. So, like that, the same way it is with IT. You look at a few computers, but the computers are... You cannot put them together or take them apart completely. They stare. You do a couple of things, and voila. You know, you're not... Yeah. Okay. So, you have... Okay. All right. So, I get it. You're talking about the differences in level of training- Right. ... and [crosstalk]. And that skill level between foreign technicians and US technicians.\",\n",

And my experience is, in high school, I was in a Mass experimental school system and we had this system called the model high. And it was part of, like they had a lower school, middle and upper. And one of the things about it was that a lot of the young people that went, they went because they were either kicked out or had difficulty either learn differently or whatever in the traditional school system. And so as an experiment, I thought that this is a skewed experiment because what you're doing is that you're loading the experimental school. If you're really trying to understand what could be a more advantageous school system or whatever, and you put it with folks who, in a lot of way anybody whose kid was doing well in the traditional system wouldn't take them out and put them in an experiment. So we was filled with kids who had behavioral issues, or had some difficulty in a lot of ways in dealing with the typical system. And so that was one reason why I think that it never got on track because of the results. When I see that happening again, I see the same ideas about trying to open up the classroom and trying to not have grades and trying to design schools that try to meet the students where they are and just going through the same cycle.

So I\\'m a parent of a black son and a parent of a black daughter. So I get to see how they treat them differently. And I\\'m also a parent in the school system. So I can see firsthand of how home culture can get confused with school culture and the school culture is totally different and teachers are doing the best that they can, but there will never be a connection without that home culture. So that\\'s where they misunderstand and misinterpret our children\\'s signs. Somebody might see my son as aggressive, but it\\'s probably passionate or a cry for, \"I don\\'t understand.\" When you have teaching tools or you\\'re trying to say, \"Okay, well, this kid needs to learn social, emotional growth and tools to voice what the issue is that all school year, you say, \"It\\'s okay, you can be mad. It\\'s okay, you can be mad, but just tell us what you need.\" And then when you see that student actually voice what he needs and is not being listened to by the same people who drill the venom, \"We\\'re here to listen,\" it\\'s like, \"What?\" But then it\\'s a lot of the policies to that have crippled some of these teachers and crippled the children that\\'s trying to keep the children and the parents safe and also the teachers safe. So it\\'s to be able to see that and to go through some experiences as a mom of a black child with another teacher and see like whole, it\\'s like, yeah, educational system use my languages like that because of the world spent, the teachers not talking to the parents and the parents are afraid of the teachers and the teachers are afraid of parents, but nobody is willing to tell them that. And the kid is in the middle, you can see his book. And the kid becomes smarter than both of the teachers and learn how to play, both of them by using the same policies that they implemented for the teachers and the parents to keep them safe. So it\\'s just like... Yeah. So she said that, right?',\n",

It\\'s a lot of the infrastructure I believe. I don\\'t know how to like put it. So it\\'s like, might\\'ve been these policies, like who makes these policies? Because I don\\'t live in public housing. So public housing is a lot easier to pick up the phone and say, \"Hey, I think I have been racially discriminated,\" and they\\'ll do something about it quicker, the private low-income housing. So that infrastructure too was just like, it\\'s like, \"What?\" So they can take... If the property manager don\\'t like you for whatever reason, it doesn\\'t mean necessarily have to be something you did. Just by the color of your skin. They do little things. They\\'ll take a lot longer to fix something or forget you completely. And it\\'s like if you go in reports at 1010, yeah, they\\'ll get a spank on at risk or whatever, whatever, but then it\\'s like, they use the other system like when it comes time for your certification and hard and use certain words to make you feel inadequate, like non-compliance and all this other stuff where this can go the record. So the policy piece is really strong for me because it\\'s like a lot of these people that make these policies and put them in place are not actually the people that live in through them. So it\\'s just like, they don\\'t know how that makes a person feel. And then again, you\\'re raising family, you have to disregard all of that. And the push is like all of that and make sure you still raise your kids the right way so that when they go up, they don\\'t make the same mistake or they don\\'t have a certain type of hate just because somebody is Hispanic or white or whatever or is black.

But there were universities and hospitals. Their fundraising staff in the same community-based fundraisers, I don\\'t know, maybe 15 years ago might\\'ve been longer. I was at the Boston Foundation and I was just like, \"We\\'re in deep do-do if the funding dollars that somebody would that our budgets and our capacity to raise money.\" So not only do they... Yeah. So like, how do you compete with when you have a part-time grant writer with Berkeley School of Music\\'s development staff, so talking about inequity? And then nonprofits. And then like biggest pet peeve of a big nonprofits in Boston is they don\\'t pay taxes. They don\\'t pay taxes. So homeowners in Boston... These homeowners in my opinion, subsidize big institutions. And that\\'s another policy whack thing that I don\\'t understand. Because look at what CEOs of some of these hospitals make. They could fund that whole neighborhood just this hour.

Also growing up, I grew up very poor and Southern Illinois grew up in like a mobile home and stuff. And it\\'s this weird disconnect because I can remember I went to the Harvard School of Public Health and I can remember being there and feeling so out of place with my background and being like, I was walking around and be like, \"Oh God.\" I was like fixing the thing there would be my dad. Like he would be the mechanic guy doing that. And then also, financially I had so little money. I had a student loan, but there were barriers to like getting the money. And there was a period of time where I had like a week where I couldn\\'t buy groceries. So I was like hungry. It was such this weird feeling because I\\'m like, \"I\\'m freaking at Harvard.\" And I can\\'t eat. And the person in the financial aid department was really nasty, like the way he talked to people. And I can remember he would say to me, \"I don\\'t know when your loan\\'s coming in.\" And I\\'m like, \"Well, I\\'m hungry.\" And it\\'s like, \"Okay.\" And then several months later, the next semester, when I was waiting for my loan again, I felt more empowered in and somebody said, \"You need to write a letter to the Dean.\" So I did. And of course, because it\\'s Harvard and they\\'re off privilege and they don\\'t want to look bad, he called me in and he was horrified that I went through that. So he fired the financial aid lady, but see, that\\'s still not really solving problems because it\\'s like, \"Look just who you were talking about to.\" So there\\'s just these layers of layers of things. It\\'s like, \"Well, that\\'s hard.\" So he could just fire him. And then he\\'s like, \"I\\'m really sorry.

Okay, Erica, I'm going to interrupt you. Your question, love. My question is, how do I help connect these people that I know who are progressives and care about this, but who somehow, I feel like there's a gap in there, in how they think it needs to be addressed, and they don't quite see the gross inequity. How do I talk to them, educate them, involve them more in what I think is something they care about but maybe aren't seeing the whole picture?

We do have a lot of development that's going on in Mattapan, and I think that we could do a better job as individuals to know more about what that means, and then, also bringing in folks to share that information. Then, TMJ, with the Neponset River being right in my backyard and a space that I spend a lot of time in, again, my neighbors not necessarily being that ... I don't want it to seem like ... I'm being careful on how I word this. It just seems like they don't really care. Whenever the king tides happen, that's just the way it is, and what it is that they, as individuals, all of us can do to help us prepare for that, it's been a conversation, just as an individual, not a professional, that I've wanted to have with folks. I find myself just getting some of that resistance. I don't own, and so I am one of those people in some of these spaces.

I lived Somerville for years, so I've only been actually in Boston for a much shorter time, so I don't have that context of living here, but I feel like there is, probably from decades back, just a culture of ... There's been an inner clique, and an inner circle in Boston, even though it's such a small city. Then, everyone else is not supposed to be part of that.

That\\'s interesting. I think that\\'s deep. What would hold you here? I also have to share that I was a military child, so we moved around often.

And when I was growing up in Boston, we just had a lot more of integrity about our space, and principal about who we were and where we came from. I always learned to respect my elders, and always look out for other people who come before me, so those are the people who I work with it or I try to learn from now. And I feel like that stuff is getting erased. Not a lot of students that I teach now, they know nothing about their leaders. There\\'s not enough of us out there becoming young leaders for the youth, so it\\'s about really painting a bigger picture for the future. I know this because I\\'m in Upham\\'s Corner community, and I feel like a lot of the people who I feel are leaders, are not represented enough to be able to carry through with their legacy, and with the moves that they want to make, because we don\\'t have a place where the vision is held, like archived of all this stuff. Where we can say, \"This is proven to be done and we need these people back again.\" I just think that there should be more say. A lot of people should have a better say, more voice around what they want to see in their community. But we have to preserve the legacy and also bring that back into the educational system, which will hopefully amplify the historical landmarks that we have, so they can\\'t be erased. I want to advocate for that more. I think there\\'s a lot of neighborhood legacy. I want to advocate for that, just try to make that something before it just disappears, and it\\'s not the same anymore. Create a better community by educate with the youth too, about where they\\'re at, because the community is special too. And I feel like a lot of us don\\'t know, because we\\'re not walking outside enough, or talking to our neighbors enough and stuff. Doing that just makes you feel like you belong in the community, and we need to keep that feeling, instead of having it feel like there\\'s no community, or it doesn\\'t feel like the same community.',\n",

I didn\\'t actively do that.\" However, I do have friends who live outside of Boston, they live in Randolph and they don\\'t have to search for the community meetings. They\\'re welcome to come there. They\\'re basically told to show up, whether it\\'s a neighbor who comes by the house or however, they get your information and they\\'re letting you know. And I\\'m not sure, there could be something that goes on in Boston, where they actually let folks know about the community meetings, and it\\'s known or it\\'s somewhere where people should be able to see it. But from my experience, it\\'s not something that I hear about too often, of community meetings that are happening in Dorchester.

But seeing working with students, getting into these colleges, there may be a couple of colleges that may seem oh, it's very easy to get in. It's easy to get accepted, yada, yada. But as you're working through the transition process, you find out, you easily got accepted, but now you have to jump all of these hurdles. And then the number just drops from like students who actually matriculate. And I noticed that that's like a common theme across the board. And that's one of those examples of well, you were denied access, because of what? So you can look at some of the data and it paints this picture. The picture looks like racism or any other isms or whatever. When you look at the data and look at access and look at the students, the demographics are the students who just don't have access, like they did it at first. I can go on and on about that.

It doesn't matter how hard they work and what kind of activities they participate in, they still is a college is not guaranteed for all of them for few maybe depends on what people to have on their way. Even if they get through college, they graduate from college, but it's going to be hard for them to find a job because they are undocumented.

Because they grew up here, they only speak English, but if they try to go back, they'll get arrested at the airport and drive to the army. So I know there's people haven't been able to go back home for a long time. And we, Korea also put a pause on adoption for the US, because a lot of Koreans that were adopted by US couples, a lot of them didn't bother to finish their paperwork.

And where we are now, just some of the struggles and the access that we have. I mean, it's pretty unfortunate I find myself... I don't consider myself a Boston native, but I am born and raised here and I can't afford to stay here. And for me, that's heartbreaking, because I feel like, as was said, earlier, I felt like I'd done all the things that I was supposed to do. Stayed in school, was a good kid, went to college, finished and even came back to my city to work and still I have to do it on my own. And so it will just be interesting to see what will it look like for those who are growing up who look exactly like me, who want to do the same thing. They also want to go off to school, they also want to continue to remain that good kid and come back and actually do work in their community, and then be embraced by it and be able to live here, instead of having to go to other cities, not knocking other cities around the US. It's beautiful for us to be able to travel and enjoy other spaces. But my friends are fleeing Boston, for many reasons and racial reasons, financial reasons, they're all leaving. And it's fine as I said, it's always nice to have growth and expansion, but what is the reason?

I think about this Boston that so many people admire, you watch the news and you see all the college students moving in to Boston, all over to go to school and you heat the parent on the news, talking about helping their child move in to go to school from Boston, because Boston has the best fist. We're leading in education, we have the best colleges and universities. Even Boston, Boston was promoted on Grey's Anatomy. The medical institutions down here was promoted on shows and other shows, but was promoted on stuff like Grey's Anatomy, Boston. And it's amazing, the view that people who live outside of the city has versus the view folks have that live within Boston. And just like I said, some folks are trying to get out of Boston. And I think that we need to be okay with that. I grew up in the city. I came to this country when I was seven years old, but I grew up in Boston, didn't know anything else, but Boston. And I would not buy a home in Boston. I just wouldn't. I am tired of the city. I'm tired of the violence in the city. I'm just tired. And there's a lot of collective trauma in the city of Boston that needs healing, collectively. Boston is traumatic. So there's benefits, but there's a lot of traumas in our community and a lot of trauma in Boston. There's just healing that needs to happen. I said it to somebody the other day when they try to entertain this conversation even about politics and the outcome of the mayoral race. I just feel like we're so confused. We're so divisive. The same people that yell unity are the same ones that are throwing out. Instead of being divisive, the same people that say we need to work together are the same people that are marginalizing other people and it's frustrating. I think there's definitely a balance, that you have to walk in optimism. Understanding you're going to be pessimistic, but just having a balance and not allow it to overtake you mentally, physically, emotionally, I just refuse. And if, for me having to move out of this city to find some level of peace, then that's what I had to do. So yeah, that's my thoughts.\",\n",

Many of them who have finally gotten their places, had to move at least an hour outside of the city, and if they work in the city have to commute.

And we teach our students that if you work hard and invest in yourself at some time down the road, you're going to be able to have financial stability. And that is such a scam that we teach young people, because it doesn't matter what industry you're in, there are so many barriers. I've had a ton of career just roadblocks because I'm a woman or because I'm Asian or because there's a misunderstanding about my level of education or knowledge. So there's all of these little roadblocks within individual experience that we don't address and when you keep telling people that you work hard, you'll get there. But it really depends on what industry you're in. When I worked in tech, it was insane to me that they were paying me so much just for an assistant level position whereas when I was doing something that I loved in design, I was making less than all of my peers. So no matter how hard I worked or how much further along, I move through moved up in whatever industry is like that, trying to close that gap was an uphill battle. It makes me frustrated, because it's not a lack of trying hard that people are struggling, it's not because people are lazy or because they're not educated. I know plenty of people who work in Starbucks and they have a PhD. So it really how do we want to address it because people do want to work and they do want to contribute and have legacy and have impact, but there are so many gatekeepers. So how do we want to address that going forward? We can't have a sustainable society when we aren't addressing any of this.\",\n",

That was the closest place that they could find affordable housing in the early 2000s, to support a young working class family with three children. And now moving back towards the city is not an option for me personally, just because of the cost of housing, as previously mentioned. And I think that this is a extremely pressing issue, just because I think there's this attraction to Boston from top talent, for our top universities, for medical care for these hospitals that young doctors want to work at. All of these great, like high-end resources that are attracting outside talent, when there's also that talent within Boston. I think there needs to be more of an effort to provide those resources to people who are from Boston and willing to put in the work, because there are students in Boston Public Schools, in the Boston Metro Area that are willing to do that. But living in Boston just isn't an option because of the cost of actually living in the city and being close to those amenities outside of living with family or friends.

So we have a lot of failures at interest rate or the transition part between high school and college. Seeing those, it's kind of weird to me. And expression in terms of like arts. That's just an example. But thinking of Latin Quarters in Jamaica Plain and thinking of Nubian station. Nubian Square, seeing how those aren't just titles, but it does represent something and it does express something culturally. So I do understand that that is powerful, especially fighting against things like gentrification. So I'm wondering what that would look like. And the other one was real inclusion in policymaking. So just being at different community meetings. One, specifically in South End, I don't want to go too much in detail, but just seeing how developers and just leaders of the communities and seeing how they can... It seems like the actual people live in the communities are actually marginalized, even within the community meeting. So a lot of things that are important to them that they collectively think are important, it seems like it's not paid attention to these policies happening, these things happening, they get moved out. And people think that the community isn't saying anything, but the community is but nobody's listening.\",\n",

So, I think it's a huge issue that they're going to have to, overall, really deal with. Personally, I think the hybrid isn't a bad thing because it's a happy medium. And we do have to function and move forward, but there are requirements in place for safety measures.

       "  'words': 'A lot of these topics resonate with me. Firstly, I am a homeowner through one of Boston\\'s programs that help to give affordable homeownership, but I believe like there are some loopholes that stifle our people. When you go through this process, it doesn\\'t allow for advancement. What? It doesn\\'t allow for advancement, they don\\'t have any resources for the homeowners after the purchase, any guidance. And then, as Dorothy had said, they tend to... When you come up with an issue with the house and the quick build of that, money rules the factor of giving these contractors the job to do something, and then they use cheap materials and product. And I don\\'t know if the inspection process part of it is skipped over just to get pushed along just to get the home sold. And then the City\\'s not tentative to the homeowners when they get into a serious situation. And then the reason why you go through that is because of, like what Tarazer said, the pricing, the pay that you make. Half a million dollars for a property that\\'s probably not equal to a half a million dollars\\' worth of property. And also to piggyback is: are they trying to do what they did in the \\'60s and move the colored people back onto the outskirts so it\\'s comfortable for the upper class, so to speak, people to be able to access their jobs more easily and make things convenient? It\\'s okay that we share, but be fair. So, don\\'t just push us all out or whatever after we\\'ve built up the community and the livelihood of all the neighborhoods and brought that equity back, and now you slyly just push the minority population of the Dorchester Roxbury Mattapan communities out. And I hope that those fears don\\'t come into the homeowners and they stay with their properties, because there\\'s people that come out here like, \"We\\'ll buy your house for X, Y, Z.\" And the money sounds enticing to the homeowners that are minority and don\\'t have much, but they need to stand their ground and stay in these properties and have something to pass on to their children or their family afterwards.',\n",

I try to do some research on re-entry in prison and see what's out there and there's places that do stuff but, like George was saying, it's half ended. They have all these good intentions. They give us all these hopeful resources, but access to these resources and the practice of these resources once we have access to there's disconnect.

And you can allow them that moment where they can really share what their challenges are. And I think that's what we have. We have such a diverse group here that has so many very challenges that are consistent with what's going on in Boston and Massachusetts in general. Although the challenges are throughout the world, at least we have something where this is a beacon, a strong beacon. It's great to hear us talk about it. And also the things that we have done as a group recently to try to just build that sense of strengthened togetherness so that we do come with the power of a strong hammer force to bust loose some of these challenges and at least give people the chance to voice them. And hopefully we can then turn around and disseminate that to those that need to hear it and marry those victories in our own lives so that we offer people with (Inaudible) examples that they can use to begin to face some of the biggest steps that they know they have to go forward with.

We\\'ve been living in that space now for, he\\'s 11 years. I have to make my daughter share a room with my son. And so, that brings into play a lot of back and forth, because the age difference there plus the gender. He\\'s a male and she\\'s a female, and she\\'s now into teenager and he\\'s still a young adolescent. So, it\\'s a lot of tit for tat going on. It\\'s always a rush in the morning. \"I can\\'t find this,\" or, \"He has that,\" duh, duh, duh. So all of that is like you wake up and you have to ... All right. This person\\'s going to fight because of that person. This person\\'s going to fight. So, there\\'s certain things you have to do to be prepared to wake your kids up that share that space so that they won\\'t have to fight anymore so you can have your mental with one bathroom.

My mom, God rest her soul, she passed away 11 years ago. But, my family was always a firm believer in making sure that your family had some place to go. So, my mom passed. She passed the house on to me and my brother, and I was able to have that. So, don\\'t ever say, \"I need to get my credit.\" Listen, you\\'re going to get there. I hear you. A lot of my friends have had to move to Middleborough and Taunton and Fall River, and just Braintree. They were in shelters and they have the kids, the same, but they had to move out to get a three bedroom. They can\\'t get stay in Boston. None of my friends that I grew up with are here. They\\'re all out in East wherever, and I\\'m like, \"I can\\'t visit y\\'all.\" I\\'m just here because my mom left me a house. That\\'s why. And I\\'m thankful for that, it\\'s a lot, but that\\'s why. It\\'s not because ... well, I worked on my credit, but that\\'s not why. Yeah, it is sad that we can\\'t stay here and we can\\'t raise our kids here. This is where we grew up at. I grew up here. I don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen when she gets old enough to take over if something happens to me, my older daughter or something like that. I don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen, because I don\\'t know if anybody can afford to live here. The taxes are ridiculous here. So, people are moving out. I\\'ve questioned whether should I still stay here. I used to walk from my house to Tufts Medical Center when my mother got sick. I cannot walk from my house to Tufts Medical Center anymore because I\\'m scared to. And remember, I\\'m 47, so I grew up in the \\'90s and I wasn\\'t scared of anything. I could walk up and down Washington Street and walk everywhere and walk downtown. But I\\'m scared now, because of Mass and Cass. I can\\'t walk through the side streets anymore. I would not dare do that. So if there was something that we could do to find out if we could get those three bedrooms, but everything that they\\'re building right now doesn\\'t even have a three bedroom attached to it. It\\'s always a loft or they\\'re building $500,000 condos or lofts. They\\'re splitting that. They\\'re buying houses up around the neighborhood because now it\\'s for cash, and a lot of the families have moved out. So, they\\'re selling them, unfortunately, and they\\'re splitting the houses. Put them in two or three family houses. They\\'re splitting them into $500,000 condos or lofts now.',\n",

Mental health, and particularly for a man of color in this country, in this city. I lost my son 11 years ago, and had only started to truly grieve three years ago as I joined an all-Black, all-male group. And within that group, we share our pain, our struggle to be equal, and I found a certain level of peace from losing my son. When I lost my son, I had vowed to give back to the community because they gave to me. And we were very fortunate in that respect. When my son passed, when he was sick in the hospital, he fell sick on Valentine's Day of an enlarged heart. Dilated cardiomyopathy. My daughter, on the other hand, had that issue. We knew about it, and she had treatment along the way. He was a complete surprise. He passed away subsequently after hospitalization on Mother's Day. My relationship with my ex did not last. My relationship with myself was suppressed. And until I came home, and I call Boston home now, and got involved with the community, with a men's group that allowed me to share my story, and give back because of the gratitude I live with today.

We have some dysfunctional pain and unmet trauma, post-traumatic stuff. And we have some epigenetic stuff that was given to us from our grandmother\\'s grandmother\\'s grandmother due to how we were brought up. So, the future has to start with oneself and how you self-heal. How you address whatever you went through, reaching out to the agencies and organizations or the men or the women that you know that\\'s a heart to heart, a soul to soul connection because sometimes it doesn\\'t have to be from your local clinic or your hospital. It could be that basketball coach or that gymnastic coach, or that pastor or that minister that the Creator has placed in your life. So for me, listen, it starts with healing. And that\\'s what it was with all my barriers that I was able to overcome to have a testimony like Tony talked about, was truly what allowed me to really dig deep and say, \"Listen, I can\\'t really focus on Boston. I have to focus on me and my circle. But I have to be a part of Boston by planting the seed.\" I have seven children. They\\'re not doctors and lawyers, but they\\'re all great human beings.

Because someone who's working for $10 or $12 an hour, that's not considered affordable housing, because they can't afford to pay the $1600 rent for a one-bedroom.

So, our hearts are actually in our mouths while we send our kids to school, when back in the day, 10, 20 years ago, we never had school violence and all that. So, I can relate with those comments that folks have made about education, security in their environment, and especially also, she just talked about mental health. I think mental health is a very serious issue in all our communities, and I don't think it's been given the needed attention. Even if they do, like I mentioned, there's disparities in how the delivery network give attention to mental health illness, and how folks who have mental health illness have been cared for. I think I would love to see, down the road, how this is taken seriously, and how folks on the streets should be evaluated if, for any reason, they show any signs or factors to classify them to have mental illness, they should get the necessary care. They should be able to access care and not wait until they become very sick and they start to act out and throw them in jail. I think the system somehow have failed us in that regard. We'll continue to hope and look forward to a situation where all those are corrected, and we'll continue to give needed attention, support, everything that's needed to make mental health issues, give awareness to people about mental health issues, and give care and concern to it so that we can save those who have mental health, and save our communities too.\",\n",

She was like, she's 48 and she was in elementary school so it was a long time ago. And my landlady who had bought the house for... It was a three family house we were living in, raise my rent from 700 to 1100 in one year and I had to move. And so, we moved to Jamaica Plain. And then several years later... I mean, I was real mad and angry, even though I was a leader of the Brookline Tenant Union, coordinated the entire towns' election and all the 20 precincts, and I just felt powerless and just left and contested. Anyway, a couple of years later, in '95 or '96, I was renting in Jamaica Plain, and a friend of mine [Chrissolio] who had become a realtor, who I knew from years ago, told me about this first-time home buyers program that the city ran. That if you went to this class downtown you could get a $2,000 grant or loan that would turn into a grant from the city to buy a home if you were a first-time home buyer. And it was for low-income people, which I wasn't making a lot of money at the time so I qualified. And so, I went through this, got the thing, and I found an apartment, 94 Forest Hills Street, in Jamaica Plain, for $72,000 and was able to buy it through this first-time home buyers thing. I got a grant, I got a special, soft second mortgage through the Mass Affordable Housing Alliance and bought this place. And I lived there for several years. Later, Jessica and I got married, we moved to Arlington, I still own it. That apartment, it's your basic triple decker, tens of thousands of other triple deckers, not the whole building, just one floor, a thousand square feet, two bedrooms and a front room is now assessed by the city at about $500,000. I mean, that's crazy to me. So, how can anyone... I mean, I could never buy that house now, even though I make good money. And my daughter who moved to Phil... She's 48, bought a house in Philadelphia for 200 and something thousand dollars, could never, even though she makes a lot of money with her partner. So, that's my question. And that's my story. I mean, I was able to do it because I'm old, I'm 74, in '95/'96 I could buy this place with 72,000 and maybe by inflation, it might be 150 if normal inflation would take place, but it's 500. So, that's my question, how has anyone who's not a gazillionaire going to be able to live and stay in Boston. That's my story. And I'm sticking with it. And I'm done.\",\n",

Now, the problem is that Walsh, because of his ties to construction industry let developers take over this initiative and the developers, they\\'re not so interested in quality of life issues or even in costs. Now they came up with this term called affordable housing, which is actually a developers term and what it amounts to is a slight reduction of rent for a year. Now, that\\'s not really going to help a lot of people in the long run, but it provided the developers with an excuse who I erect here in my part of towns, literally hundreds of high rises, which is going to have a completely disastrous effect in terms of climate change issues in the near future, and the delivery of city services, including water and sewer, electric service is going to be deteriorated because every source has already said they don\\'t want to provide more equipment. So we\\'re facing a crisis of infrastructure mainly, and also a surging population that we can\\'t possibly handle, because I mean, the rat situation here in this part of town is already out of control, as you know rats bring disease and cause other problems. So we\\'re looking at, between one issue and the other, we\\'re looking at it very large deficit in terms of quality of life in the near future. What can be done about it? Well I do have a solution, but nobody wants to hear it. Somebody, an entity or a group, needs to file a class action suit against the BPDA. Nobody wants to do that because they\\'re a very powerful organization, but I don\\'t see another solution. I spent all day with these groups online, discussing these issues, so I\\'m pretty well-informed, but we\\'ll end up saying the same thing, \"We feel powerless to do anything about it.\" And this ties into what Michael was talking about also, and what Paul was talking about, and I think we\\'re all talking around the same kinds of issues that Boston, it\\'s not Paris, it\\'s not London, it\\'s not LA, we don\\'t have that physical space here, which was an issue with the Olympics.

But the problem with the housing issue that both of us faced is really the same that Boston does not have a lot of housing stock and the housing stock they're building is not going to help, because it doesn't serve families, and children, especially, these high rises are very dangerous for children. There's nowhere for them to play and so forth, so the housing issue still is critical to many groups of people whether they're homeowners or tenants, whether they're young, or old, or retired, or students, we all are vying for the same piece of the pie here. And the pie is very small to begin with, because this is a small town and this is the problem. Boston has always been a small town and we've always been somewhat in denial about it. And the problem now is, is because the other issue involving construction has reduced the amount of green space. I didn't bring that up, which also is going to contribute to the adverse effects of climate change, because we have fewer trees here, we have a heat sink here in Allston because of the amount of concrete it's going to raise the temperature, that's going to use more electricity, more energy. So, we're making it worse, and at the same time, we're looking at thousands of students pouring back into the city in another few weeks and they're going to be looking for housing. And I think, I personally believe that the rents should come down, and I know their arguments against that. I had a rent controlled apartment, it worked fine for many years. I don't think people understood the law actually, which is why they voted it out. But I think that someone's got to give, it's one of those things where everybody's pulling in the same direction, somebody's got to give a little bit up here in this equation. And well, Michael, I mean, you solved your problem personally, you're not in a housing crisis yourself, but the issue continues. So, that would be my response.\",\n",

Is that because you assume it's cheaper somewhere else than Boston? Well, it probably is, but no, that's not the only reason, I have the business to consider. There are many issues, security issues surrounding the business that I have to deal with. And also my commercial. I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand what you mean by security issues surrounding the business [crosstalk]? My inventory's worth a great deal of money. And this building has security, but it's not the greatest, and increasingly we're a bit... But also the crime has increased, we are, according to the police report, there were 12 break-ins in the Brighton Center area just last weekend. This is another concern. So, it's a whole bunch of issues really, but they all point in the same direction, frankly, that I need to leave. And do you have any particular town or city you're thinking of [crosstalk] to? Well, actually, somebody suggested Lowell, because of the art scene. I don't know, I do know someone who has property there, but it's not a single-family house, so I don't know. But that area, North of Boston. North. I don't want to go south. North. So, Michael, you're responding to Florella's [crosstalk] Story about wanting to leave. And I just wanted to clarify, she said, I think in part, was it also because of the, you said security of the inventory you have because of the break-ins and I think you said this, but I'm not sure also, because of the cost of buying a single-family home in Boston is much more than it would be in Lowell or some other place. Oh, yeah. Michael, I wouldn't even consider doing it here anymore. Not only because... [crosstalk] It's because... Here's the problem that we're facing. This gets into politics, and voting, that's another issue I wanted to talk about, but the problem here is that I walked through Brighton every day on my way to work and home after home is no longer a single-owner home. They're all apartments, they're all, not that many condos, they're all rentals. And so, as a result of this, there is no voter base in this part of town. And that's a serious issue, because these people are running for office who's going to vote for them? Nobody around here, that's a problem. That's a serious problem. So, that's another issue.\",\n",

You see all this self-congratulation, for example, about the burst, even the census released his first batch of numbers, which ignores the fact that Boston's black population has decreased. And so, what happens is we get all kinds of rhetorical play, but when it comes to matters of substance, be it broad policy, or be it something as basic as rat control, we will essentially considered to be expendable, and I stress it, even when these requests come from organized groups, the city feels that there's no downsize to ignoring it. Even when the complaints come to district elected officials, be they on the council, or be they in the State House about events in their district, I get the feeling that everything is performative. And as I mentioned before, because for certain things I can generally resolve in person, but we can't because I can't be in person. I find this thing more frustrating than usual.

I mean, Paul, can you describe what you mean by militant disengagement? Yes. These are people that have made a rational decision, based on their lived experience that they get nothing back from government at any level. And as a result of that, they come to the conclusion that public participation, maybe beyond the neighborhood association level, is a fool's errand. And because their premise that government in their experience does not care about them as citizens, as residents, as people, that decision not to vote is rational. I can deal with trying to make a counter argument, but it's difficult to do so successfully, again, because their premise is correct, that they, however you want to define them, don't care about us.\",\n",

And then they could charge whatever they wanted, and then it started all over again. So, it wasn't, at least in my case, it wasn't keeping an apartment at a certain level forever, it was only the length of a tenancy. But it did tend to encourage longer-term tenancies, which was good thing, and also people tended, I think, to do their own, I certainly did, their own repairs and their own take care... They had more sense of responsibility in terms of the unit. And now, there's no sense of responsibility. It's like a hotel room, essentially. That's what I see from the transients and younger tenants, they have no investment whatsoever. It's like a hotel room to them, a nine month hotel room. And they couldn't care less about the property, they couldn't care less about the town or they certainly don't care about who's running for office, locally, or even maybe a wider spectrum. But these are some of the issues that are tied in. It's, the point I was trying to make, it's a complex problem with many facets. So, that's why it's a good issue in a sense.\",\n",

When I talk about my story, it's painful, it's like reliving trauma. I talk about the times being spit on by drunken white boys and go on to Cub Scout when I was nine years old. That's painful to talk about, because I could still smell the liquor in the spit, which has a bad smell. I mean, I talk about being a young kid growing up in Mission Hill running a major community center and was initiated with Charles Stuart murder when a pregnant white woman was alleged killed by a black man, and those are all a hunt for every black men, civil rights savagely violated, pants pulled down in front of the center, I was going to become the director, couldn't happen to me. That's painful, so I can go on and on. One of the officials in that year, when we started dunk the boat doing a couple of years later in 1992, one of the officials was my brother who was murdered on Christmas Day in 1992. So, when you talk about stories, and then you're asking people to come tell this story, that brings knowledge to those who are collecting it and look at us as being experiments. So, I think it's important that we compensate when we talk about equity, when we talk about reaching people that have been overlooked, mistreated, literally written off, and then you're asking them to relive that experience, it's painful. So, that's why I was hesitant. And you're going to hear many stories like that, and it is traumatic to go through this. I'm sitting here with people that I love, I'm sitting here with people that I trust, but it's still painful to even talk about what I'm experiencing. So, that's why I was hesitant in telling that story. So, as I continue with this project, and as I talked to my staff and those that are part of this campaign, take into consideration that people are dealing with a lot of stuff, whether it's health, whether it's poverty, and whether they feel comfortable being able to tell this story. The people that don't look like them, that they don't trust, that they don't want to tell their business, that they don't want to hear from them how to be black, and what we need. So, it's hard being a black man in America, is hard being a black man in Boston. That's my story.\",\n",

I mean, they live in the suburbs. They come to Boston to work. So, Boston is the gateway to all the other towns in Massachusetts. Boston is always going to be around, may the future look dim or bright. What these candidates need to understand, they need to be accounted, like she said, for the things that go on in Boston. Boston is not a forgotten town. Boston is [inaudible]. Everyone all across the world know about Boston for sports, or for its history, and whatever. These candidates should continue to follow that trend to make Boston as popular as it is today. So, I see Boston as being very bright from my experience, because I've been in Boston since the '60s. As each year comes and go, things do get better, but not a lot better, but they are getting better, as long as we, as Bostonians, learn how to deal with the racial injustice, the criminal system, and all that type of... housing for the homeless, things for the seniors.

I did not want to live in my parents' house, but I really had no choice because I couldn't afford rent though it was a lot lower than it is now, but now it would have totally been out of the question for me.

What's the plan to do it? So, yes, I definitely resonate with that question and then even take it further to think about the process to see how we eliminate the problem. And then also with the MBTA, it's been a long time since I've taken the MBTA, but I know that it has always been an issue for us in our community. And I don't know if it's because people just didn't care or if it wasn't important to them, that it was important to us to get to where we needed to get to on time so that we can keep our jobs or that we don't have to experience detention in school. Because that was my issue back then when I did have an issue with the MBTA is that, if the bus was late and then crowded on top of that, it would just pass us by. And so, I would always get to school late and I don't care what time I got up to try to make it early if all the students trying to get to school early too.

No father figure, no uncles, no older brothers. So no real great example of what a male should be and what males need to be doing. So, I would say, the first program was the Paul Robeson Institute and they were located where Ruggles is, so is T accessible. And I won't get in too deep in that. It was an awesome program. It was every Saturday, but you had mentorship and you had apprenticeship. So you could do shop, you could do fashion, you can do whatever it may be and you had an experience. You also walked away with the projects, so is a project based program and everybody in there, I still interact with on certain levels. Keith Motley was one of the head organizers. I think he was at UMass last, I don't know what's going on with brother Motley but that's what I'm saying. You still have brother Motley doing a lot of things throughout the city of Boston, and I can pick up the phone and call him. I have people like you from the Chica Project.

That's all the fences, and grates, and the police, and cameras, and alarms and all the barriers that we use to protect ourselves and I'm wondering, how can we pull those resources that we currently spend protecting ourselves from each other, to help us all to thrive? I'm sure that when you put all those things together, there's enough to house everyone, educate everyone, provide the transportation we need and the medical care we need iff we can pull those protective resources.\",\n",

But anyway, I grew up in Vermont where, in my high school, that was the first time I was in school with an African-American person in high school. And then there were three people of color in my whole high school and they were the same family. One of their name was Washington and they weren't in my class, of course, but I come from a long line of New England- You cut off. You're off. You put mute by mistake. You said you come from a long line of? Of Quakers, New England people. So clearly my philosophy, having come of age in the time of the civil rights like, oh, I didn't know that was a problem, but of course yeah, everybody's equal. I mean, I don't know any people who are different from me, but yeah that makes sense. So I didn't really have that real life experience. Of course, my ancestors are privileged and therefore, we know that they've benefited from slavery and all those things, but I didn't know anything about that, so you could call me innocent I suppose in the naive sense of the word. But now, of course, I've been here, I've been in Boston since 1972. That's a long time and I have a lot of experience. So this afternoon when I was out walking, I should say I live maybe a half mile from Nubian Square and so, I walked out bound toward Nubian Square through Nubian square, and then kept going. So, I did a big loop going down Blue Hill Avenue coming back on Warren Avenue, and I see lots of people and many of those people are averting their eyes when they get close. There's no good afternoon, and I kind of understand that's because of the racial difference and it's just very sad because I certainly would like to connect and yet I have to tune into a conversation like this to do that.\",\n",

So now I'm looking at Boston personally, because, even though I'm from New York City, I feel like Boston is the city that can set an example for the rest of the United States. Racism is throughout the United States. I'm an advocate for education and it's a huge disappointment to come to Boston, which I feel is the city of education and across the river is Harvard and MIT and like a two or three stops on a train, you're in Boston and I'm hearing about children in schools that are crumbling are afraid to go to the restroom and then forget about the pandemic. So I don't want to go on about it because it just gets me so angry. But I am all about education and I'm really happy that this program is happening because we really need to listen and find the people that are afraid to speak because I believe those are the people that, maybe they're fearful, but I believe those are the people that have the answers and maybe they're not courageous or they're afraid to step forward, but I believe with programs like this, it might give them an opportunity to speak. And if any of these mayors or government officials are smart, they should start listening. From the middle school child up into the seniors that are also being ignored. So, that's my two cents. So I really hope Boston changes. Between the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd, these are big wake-up calls and from this point forward there's no excuse for us to make, not only Boston, but the rest of the United States, just a better place and set an example globally.\",\n",

       "  'words': \"why are our schools in Boston still segregated in terms of I guess race? In terms of that, I think that in Boston, there's like a very covert racism in terms of over racism in terms of other places in the US and it's like a cover-up in terms of like how things are running in Boston specifically in Massachusetts. Our prime example is the Boston Public School system. I teach in the BPS system. I've been teaching for seven years. I used to be a teacher at a charter school, and now I'm in the BPS system. And I see the big difference in terms of just how schools are run differently and given that BPS is the oldest institution within the United States and also, the biggest public school system within Massachusetts. I definitely see that resources are not being allocated to students and students are being greatly affected and that's not seen in different parts of Massachusetts. And then, when you look at the demographics within BPS and other school systems within Massachusetts, we see that BPS is predominantly students of color. So my question would be, why is this still happening in 2021? Racism is not something that has vanished, so I know why it's happening but also like why is it happening? But it's just I guess like a rhetorical question, like why is it happening and why aren't we fixing it as a city, as a community, to make sure that students in places that are far out Massachusetts are getting the same instructions, the same love, and the same attention, the same push in Boston that they're doing in Massachusetts? I mean how I arrived to this question is just being an educator and just also being a product of the Boston Public School system, graduating and also teaching in the BPS system and teaching different systems and seeing the big difference in terms of like potential for students and how they could get to where they're supposed to be.\",\n",

And I'm like, no, I graduated from BPS system, I feel a little bit offended because I went to a BPS school and I turned out fine. And I feel like I'm a good contribution to the world.

I understand, not to say I definitely don't agree, but I understand where some of the stuff is coming from based off of just how BPS is run and how certain things, and I'm not trying to like downplay BPS like it's a bad organization, but we definitely have a lot of work to do and I just think that that was my experience of, why not be BPS. Why can't somebody from BPS go to Harvard. Don't downplay BPS, don't downplay the students in BPS. They have so much potential just like students that are in different parts of Massachusetts, whether they're in the suburbs, whether they're in the city, they definitely are capable of the same thing.

I know that they're lots bad reasons, but I grew up in a college town in Vermont and so I had an excellent education. And I came to Boston and I was committed to having my three sons go through the Boston Public School system, which they did. They graduated. They went all the way. But of course, they were smart white boys, and they were tracked well, so they probably got the best of the resources, but I know that. So I had an older son and then twin sons. The Twins were in 5th grade in an advance work program and because they were twins, they were placed in different classes, which is partly my hope that they wouldn't live as twins, that they would have their own lives. So they were placed in different classes and because of that, they had different teachers the year before they were supposed to go to where they would go to high school. I guess that was middle school. Sorry. That must have been fifth grade just before the sixth grade. And so, one of the twins went Boston Latin and the other one to Boston Latin Academy because of the teachers they had because the one who went to Boston Latin Academy had the really tough teacher who felt that she needed to treat all the kids as though they were in boot camp. And so she was really tough on them and the parents all complained the kids are getting ulcers, they are having nightmares and everything. Like it was really hard for the kids and because of that, one of my sons went to this school, one of my sons went to that school. I imagine their capabilities are comparable but I can see how it happens that because of a small difference, one goes this way and one goes that way. And certainly when there are much bigger differences, including the color of your skin and the way you speak and how much your parents were able to invest in your education, I mean, reading you stories when you were an infant or even in the womb or whatever. It's so important that the public school be the place where everybody gets what they need and I'm grateful that you're there.\",\n",

I went to Madison Park and I was the graduation line and they were like, you shouldn't be here. That they make a mistake sort of thing and stuff like that bothers at first, but then you use it as fuel to keep you going. As far as Naomi going through the system and giving back, I think of my kids growing up right now in Boston. I was fortunate one of my older kids went to a private school. But now I have my younger kids, they're going to a charter School, the LA. So I'm seeing the differences especially when you compare private to BPS and charter, but even with charter and BPS, there's just a lot of differences with the education. It's tough for you want to give the best opportunity to all of your kids or nieces, nephews, everyone around you. Everyone deserves a shot and sometimes it's not fair how things just will happen the way it does and it's really out of your control.

       "  'words': \"I had a different experience growing up in Boston. I was in BPS till like fifth grade, and then I did a program called Stepping Stone that pretty much helped me. The way I describe it to people is, it's pretty much a program that prepares you to take a test to then get to some type of private school outside of Boston. And that's what I did and I was able to get into a school in Chestnut Hill, Beaver Country Day School. And I spent six till 12 grade there. So my experiences are very different, but I know being one of five kids who went to that school, who were actually from Boston, that it's not easy. The experiences I had going to that school really molded me because it's kind of like I had an inside view into what private schools are like and what kids who have the resources from their parents and just their communities look at what they have to do versus us who have to pretty much prove ourselves constantly and fight for everything that we want to be able to stay within the conversation. So yeah.\",\n",

That's how he was able to get into private school in financial aid and everything else that brings. A lot of it is resources. But even within those resources and those programs that are available, they are limited. So from my three kids, the oldest got accepted, the other two didn't make it. So okay, you have to take a different path. One of my concerns now looking at colleges, so you have your UMass Boston Amherst etcetera. Before, those were safety schools. You didn't make it into one of those, you got into the one at UMass. Now, it's not a safety school anymore. It's difficult to get into any one of them. So my question now is, what do they fall back on? It's difficult to get into some of the limited programs and if you don't get into those then what? But let's say you make it through the high school, okay, but if you're not in the Ivy League's and you don't get into those competitive school, then what? It just seems like there's always another roadblock and it seems to be affecting certain population and maybe less impacting others. So that's a concern that I see growing as we progress. I don't see that getting easier.\",\n",

And as being a senior, the pandemic has hit, I feel our population really hard. Speaking for myself, own experience, I moved during the pandemic. I moved to West Roxbury. I live far, far, far. I feel like I lived in another land, another country. Okay? In order for me to even be able to go across the street, I need transportation to go across the street from my house. People, family are not readily accessible like they were before the pandemic. Since the pandemic, I do not get on the buses. I do not get on the trains. I just do not ride public transportation because it's kind of, sort of a scary thing, a scary thing. It was scary before the pandemic and pandemic kind of sort of like made an awareness of really just how nasty the environment was. So I don't ride public transportation anymore. Then schools got shut down. The children couldn't go to school. The children couldn't go out to play. The children were locked up in the house with no really kind of curriculum or whatever. And now like everything hasn't completely gone away. That one day, they're saying, send the kids to school. The next day they're saying, take the kids away from the school. So I'm wondering what is my grandchildren's future really going to look like as far as their academics. Then with the housing crisis and stuff going on, I'm wondering, are we going to eventually see more tent cities going up in our cities and our nation because of the housing crisis and because of the eviction moratorium, where they're evicting people because you can't pay your rent. If you can't pay your rent, a lot of people are in danger of, and maybe going to end up homeless. And at the end of the day, I look at Mass and Cass and I'm like, eventually, is this what a lot of our nation is going to be like that people are getting tents and putting up tents to be able to have places for them and their families to live in?\",\n",

I think if they're going to have that, I felt like they need to have the same respect of the road as we do. We have to be licensed. We have to be trained. We had to respect the roles of others and not take an initiative that they can ride those bicycles and not obey the traffic lights, unsafe cars coming. And why do we be penalized if one of them jokers get hit because they was out of bounds? And I just felt like that this whole train trying to get rid of people driving their cars.

I think the laws need to be changed and I think the man needs to make some changes back to where how they got these roads very narrow. It's congested. And I think it's unethical. If you're going to have a bike lane, have it through the Emerald circle, whatever. It ain't have to be on all these main roads where these bicycles, they're not respecting the road, I think, and they should be trained. They should have a license the same we do.

Because it's a health thing and it can be really bad when you have the secondhand smoke.

And in that class, it talked about somewhat like privilege, right? So what I learned was that white people are minorities. I said, \"Okay, so you tell me how that different from a urban community who majority are minorities.\" So what I was informed is because they don\\'t have access to a lot of different resources because they make a dollar more or a hundred dollars more, or $2,000 more. And so that\\'s why they don\\'t qualify for a lot of services or resources that is around. And so what I want to say in the urban community or overall across the state or the state that they reside in. And so when I learned that I had to go back and kind of really, really dig in, like, okay... So for the household, if it\\'s a household family, two parents in the household, yes, their income is going to escalate, right? And so maybe that one person, one of the members who is the breadwinner, maybe something happens along the way. And then, so they still minimize all the resources they can get they\\'re entitled to because maybe the other member of the household who was the half of the breadwinner still makes too much money because they make over 60, 70,000 a year, right? So because of that, they still not entitled, but they did become minorities. That\\'s complicated. So it\\'s so complicated because who set the barriers of what these words mean? Where it comes from? Where does it resonate from? Mm-hmm (affirmative). So that\\'s what I find such a differ in how you classify Caucasian or white, black, however you want to put it, black, brown, and beige. I put the beige in there because all of us, we all come in different formations. I ain\\'t going to say different colors because I don\\'t believe in colors, even though I could be wrong.

Like for instance, everybody knows, well not everybody knows, but it\\'s a common statistic that everyone always talks about, how the average net worth of Black people is $8, versus white people, which is $247,500. That statistic has remained for, I want to say, almost a decade, for years. That\\'s very problematic to me. The reason why it\\'s very gentrification and red-lining in the history of economic inequity to Black people, I hold that very dear to my heart. I don\\'t really talk about this experience a lot, but I\\'ve experienced homelessness, when I was in the 3rd or 4th grade. I\\'m going to read a piece. It\\'s not too long. I wrote this freshman year of high school and it\\'s called \"Home, Bittersweet Home.\" This is just a piece. We walked back from school and down the street from our home, we seen a moving truck that took us for a surprise. \"Are we moving?\" My little sister asked. That was our initial thought, but as we got closer and closer to the house, we can hear the distressed crying, screaming voice of my mother, grandparents and neighbors. When we arrived, absolutely everything, all of our belongings were thrown out, broken and laid out all over the front lawn. Strangers were throwing pieces of me out of my home. I watched as they threw my baby pictures in frames from my window room. My favorite baby doll was tossed out and falling to sudden death on the concrete. Cracked TV screens laid out on the lawn, pieces of our bedsets, now were outside with worms and bugs crawling all over it. No bed, meant no place to sleep. The refrigerator laid open on the ground, while flies swarmed all around it. My stomach ached all day from hunger, but no refrigerator, meant no food. No baby pictures, meant no more memories. Now, no house meant no home. I tried to be strong, but emotions flooded my brain and tears burst through the walls of my eyelids. Screams of my mother rang throughout the neighborhood, \"You cannot do this. These are my kids.\" With her only belonging left in her hand, her camera, she recorded this whole scene of trauma, along with my grandparents and neighbors, who were also recording and protesting the same. I sobbed while squeezing my sisters and brothers together in a group hug, hoping they wouldn\\'t get to see as much as me. Their tears floods my shirt and weeping cries muffled and echoed upon my chest. Losing everything but the love that we had for each other and with nothing but the clothes on our backs, we returned back to our only shelter that we had now, the car. We did not know where we would go next. We sat in the car waiting for my mom and grandparents to drive off, not knowing where our next stop would be, but definitely knowing it was our last stop here. So that is my experience with homelessness and it\\'s not something I talk about a lot, but that is why this is such a pressing concern, that I hold dear to my heart. Once again, let me repeat the question is, what are we going to do about gentrification? What is the City of Boston doing to close the inequity gap, to stop this economic violence that\\'s been happening to our people? So, that\\'s my question.',\n",

       "  'words': \"I ask this question, because as a young person, kind of like navigating through the artistic scene in the city, it's always been a difficult situation, figuring out different ways to get my peers involved in different opportunities to receive funding for their art, to you know what I mean? Be able to book venues for our art, if it's like performing art or even just like galleries, just be able to showcase visual arts. It's always been difficult. More recently, we've had to and I'll talk about my experience. I've had to continue to book my own shows out of Boston and I mean because the surrounding cities are so much more accepting of, you know what I mean, the types of art that we create. Also, just like the types of artists that we are, whether that's like hip hop, or R & B, or whatever it is, it's also just recognizing the value of young people and the art that we're creating. So I'm doing shows in Worcester, we're doing shows in Cambridge. You know what I mean? Anywhere that's not Boston and it's so weird because, this is where I'm from. This is where I live. This is where I grew up. So I feel like it's definitely tragic, knowing that the people, or like the places, I guess I should say. Not necessarily the people. But the place where I'm from, doesn't necessarily value or accept the art that we're creating, until it's like commodifiable. I feel like that's the key and that's the difficulty. Even like thinking about funding, I know that for me, receiving funding for my art has never necessarily been like an issue, per se. I also know that now it's becoming more of an issue, based on the types of art that I'm willing to create. You know what I mean? So when you seek and you reach out, when you seek funding, you reach out to different foundations, or organizations, you know what I mean, that are like claiming that they put this value on the artist and the creative scene, but then turn around and the art that you're creating isn't necessarily what they're looking for. Or it's like held to kind of like they understand what you're doing, but it's not necessarily what they're looking for, it's not what they want from you. Or it's too explicit, or it's too kind of like your bleeps are shining through a little too much, it becomes a problem. Then they don't necessarily want to fund you anymore. So it's interesting that kind of like that dichotomy there between what you want to create and what they'll almost allow you to create. So it's difficult, for sure. I think as the scene continues to develop and more and more artists continue to work to create and share their voices, it'll be a lot harder to ignore what we have to say. I just also know that regardless of that, there's still people in power that are going to be kind of like having an influence on that. So that's my question for the city is like, how will, you know what I mean? Will there truly be a dedication to the art scene like you said, or will it kind of just continue to be the way that it's been so far? Yeah. Yeah.\",\n",

What I mean by that is that, there are young people being groomed to be workers, or not connected and then others being groomed to lead, with the same status quo, right, and the same mentality of those who lead in the here and now. The truth of the matter is that I think that what young people collectively across the board, not just BIPOC young people, have been pushing on is, how are we creating systems that are equitable, that allow for all of their peers and their friends and the people that they care for and love and have access to, is a part of the future, a part of a positive and productive and thriving future of the City of Boston? So there's other things that I could talk about, but I think that if I tie this question into the work that we're trying to do here at Teen Empowerment, is really try to prepare young people who engage us in a way that they are equipped with the skills and the knowledge necessary for them to be leaders in the City of Boston, that will transform how these systems operate.\",\n",

Like, I'd never go in that building, like I'll never be able to, I didn't even know what you needed to do, or the skills you needed to have, in order to even have access, or be someone who could be an employee in those spaces. So it felt like I was from a whole different world and I know there are young people, even though there's more information out there now, because of media and so on and so forth.

I don't receive that same reality, if I'm in my community where people look like me. So of course, that's a difference.

Because I went to [inaudible], excuse me, I went to Bunker Hill, I fell off for a little bit. I went into the contingent workforce. Had various jobs in the city. I worked at a sneaker store that doesn\\'t exist anymore, called Expressions in Downtown Crossing. You might see locations of that in various neighborhoods in Boston and also in Rhode Island.

All these sort of pieces of labor here and there kind of thing and would really have benefited from just a stronger sort of just some sort of labor introduction, getting people understanding what the workforce is like and being realistic, if you can\\'t make it into college, in this traditional path, or in this certain path, here are some things that you can do and here\\'s somebody to work with.

And I\\'ve been doing a lot on Zoom, various things. So there are three parts of that that I wanted bring up in the experience. So last year I did some program at the Mass Historical Society on voting during a pandemic. And in the middle of that, one of the things in that is they talked about how James Michael Curley, if anybody\\'s been in by Faneuil Hall, you see the statue of him, how James Michael Curley and Honey Fitzgerald, who was mayor of Boston and the grandfather of John F. Kennedy, had this real fight and they actually changed the law at that point. So James Michael Curley, who was mayor of Boston, could not have consecutive term. I thought that was hysterical. My father\\'s a history buff and so I talked to him about that while I was driving him over to his appointment, I don\\'t know, over there. Please don\\'t even ask me which hospital it was at that point. And oh, and he said, \"Oh yeah, my father used to work on James Michael Curley\\'s campaigns.\" And I\\'m like, \"What?\" I was completely amazed. And he told me the story about my great-uncle was at a Curley rally and Curley pointed to him and said, \"You, Kid, you look cold.\" And he gave him the coat off his back. And so that coat stuck around the family for years. We later found out, when I looked into this whole thing, that he actually used to keep coats in his car, so every rally he would do, he would take his coat off and give it to some kid in the group. But anyway, it turned my family into like standout campaigns and everything like that. About the same time I drove my father over to his appointment and we\\'re coming back through Mission Hill, and he\\'s pointing out where his grandparents had lived before they moved to Roxbury. And then he kind of muttered off his oldest brother who was kind of the black sheep of the family, he said, \"Jimmy never left Mission Hill.\" So I started thinking about those things and there were a number of other things. It\\'s like my father, when they were doing busing, the early meetings on busing, we were in the public school and the reason my parents actually took us out of the public school was because my father went to every meeting, and he kept telling people that this tract of area, that they had no houses on, the map they were living that they had was... His house was in the middle of it and he had six kids. And they kept saying, \"We\\'ll figure it out when the time comes.\" And his whole attitude was, \"Well, we\\'re not going to figure it out. I\\'m going to know what to do with my kids.\"',\n",

It's how do we set Boston up to the future and honor its past? Because I think we hear way too much of this and history keeps stopping at various places. One of the other things is my father went to Roxbury Memorial for boys, which then became Boston Tech, and when Boston Tech became the O'Bryant, he moved over. Roxbury Memorial for Boys and Girls became Boston Latin Academy. And the president of his senior class is actually the last living member of Martin Luther King's fraternity. He's an activist named Herman Hermanson. He also met a young Edward Brooke working in the library over there, who was the first black senator elected since reconstruction, so he became a friend of his while he was in high school.

Sharing resources, for me, that's what I do. And since the Zoom platform has become more prevalent, my database, my resource database, has multiplied. And sometimes I feel it's who you know in terms of getting the resources that people need because they're not advertised as much as I think they should be. For me, I was once, and in certain areas I still am a recipient of various resources that the city has to offer, whether it's help with a bill, whether it's food networks, just whatever I need in my life, I know how to get it. A lot of people don't, which is a lot of the reasoning behind my advocating for people that need assistance with certain things. I think it should be advertised, the resources in Boston. And I'm not sure if but Boston has resources for some of everything that everyone could ever need. You just don't hear about them. And again, sometimes it's who you know, what agency you know, who you know that got this assistance before. But I think they should advertise more in the media, television, radio, newspaper, via Zoom, text people, put it on Facebook, wherever they can, so that people can get wind of what's available so that when they are in a bind and need things, they know how to get it. And a lot of people live behind the stigma of needing things and being needy. And that's valid. It's just the makeup of a person, you don't want people to know your business. But if you know where to get it without putting it out there to the world so people won't know your business, then I think it would be better for everyone to get what they need. Am I out?\",\n",

I necessarily did not know where I wanted to live or have a place to call my own for the rest of my life, so when I moved to Boston, 2019, summer of, I just started thinking about becoming a homeowner because rent is extremely high in Boston. I pay ridiculous rent for a small two-bedroom apartment. And so this is where I see the future of Boston. And as far as my experiences, just being a renter for a very long time, I lived on my own ever since I was 18 in various different places, and just now realizing that it's just better to invest in something that could potentially be yours, as opposed to being somebody else's. So what I've taken steps in is signing up for home-ownership classes, and just seeing where this will take me. So not saying that I will become a homeowner within the next three years or five years, but that it's just my interest has spiked since I've moved here to Boston. And hopefully there's resources, programs, assistance to help first time homeowners, females. I'm a single parent, so it's just one income coming in. Hopefully I'll be able to manage that and find something that I can call my own.\",\n",

       "  'words': 'I\\'d like to start and talk with Carmen about on your sharing about becoming a homeowner. I actually never thought of home-ownership and I\\'m 66 years old. I hadn\\'t ever thought of it until I\\'ll say probably the past 20 years. And again, I\\'ve been in Boston since 1970. And once I graduated high school and college and started working and having children, and I have three adult children and I have three grandchildren as well. And I\\'ve just been thinking of it lately because where I live, I live in a complex of 60 town homes, and the management company that works for us, supposedly, they\\'re so unprofessional. They\\'re just so... I would say slumlords if they were our landlords, but I don\\'t call them landlords because they\\'re a management company, but they\\'re the worst. They\\'re so unprofessional. They can\\'t keep a maintenance team together for two seconds. It\\'s just a mess. And I often think, \"If I owned my home or co-owned my home, we wouldn\\'t have to deal with waiting for this or them coming to do this or that.\" And I\\'ll admit, I\\'ve been a section eight recipient since 1974, 1972 actually, when I moved out from my mom\\'s home. And I\\'ve been able to maintain that, thank God, and live in Boston. Of course, the rents are just through the roof, as you all know, but home-ownership, I\\'ve been thinking about it lately, Carmen, and I have a son-in-law that he was a vet. I mean, he fought in the army and now he works for the state, and I\\'ve just been saying, \"Buy something so that we can co-own. Buy a home or have it built and build me a little, how they call it, the in-law home, or in-law unit next to it or near it. And that way you can receive the rent that I pay, the rent that the state, this year, that they pay as well.\" But he\\'s, for some reason, not wanting to do that. But just home-ownership would be so great because you have so much more of a say so in making your home as comfortable as you want it, instead of having to wait and go through the headache of people that aren\\'t doing what they\\'re supposed to do. So I live here right in Dorchester, and I\\'ve always thought home-ownership should be out in the suburbs somewhere. But no, I\\'d love to own a home right here somewhere in Dorchester, because I lived in Dorchester, Mattapan, since I\\'ve been in Boston, and I just love it. I don\\'t always love what\\'s going on outside of my door, but I love Dorchester, I really do. And I\\'d like to own a home here and the homes that they have here just cost so much. I don\\'t foresee that happening, but I\\'m onboard with you, Carmen. I\\'d love to be a homeowner. I think we all should be homeowners if we could, but I know that\\'s not... Probably not possible for everyone. But yeah, that really resonated with me.',\n",

I did drop something in the chat because, which anybody can read it, I\\'ve been thinking a lot about it and about all of the people who negotiate this world or this city or whatever, in more than one language, like Andry. And I find it kind of irritating that it\\'s not celebrated because it is such an amazing accomplishment. And I\\'ve taken language classes and I keep telling people I struggle with English, but I think it\\'s amazing and it upsets me that it is not celebrated, it is not considered one of the great benefits of Boston. So that was one way. I do own a home. I find it kind of interesting when people say, \"Oh, I never thought about owning a home,\" or anything like that because I own a home. I would not be able to buy it now, which that will be the next point, I will follow up on that. I would not be able to, like that, it\\'s falling apart. I need help to do it, but there are some issues. I would like to say there is something called NACA, naca.com, which is a low income... Helps low income, low and middle income people buy houses. So just, people can look at that. We\\'re smart and interestingly, we were able to buy the house way back when, under its previous incarnation, so I know about them. But going back to that kind of idea that I never thought... I know people choose to rent as opposed to buying houses, but that was always the default for me, is to buy a house. So I find that kind of interesting. And as I said, I would never be able to buy it now. I refer to this as I was kicked off the socioeconomic ladder. And I use the word kicked off very clearly. So when people start talking about accessing resources and everything like that and advertising, I didn\\'t know that it was a big divide. And it\\'s a communication divide. And somebody actually said to me, she said, \"My parents, my mother was a single mother on welfare.\" And we were having this conversation, there\\'s a lot to this, so nobody get offended if this comes out wrong, because it was a long conversation that went with this. And she said, \"I can\\'t imagine what it\\'s like for you to not even understand how to apply for these things.\" I\\'ve got the college degree, I\\'ve got the whole thing like that, but it\\'s a completely different language. And I don\\'t think people understand how completely different the language is and the understanding is. And I said to a friend of mine who I had known beforehand, but she had gone through struggles and everything like that. And she said, \"I was never...\"',\n",

This year when Mayor Kim Janey appointed me to the Boston Employment Commission, and I am so happy to be here because now we are in the process of creating ways that we can fine these developers and these contractors. We are putting polices and procedures in place so that when they come to the Boston Employment Commission that they... is no more slap on the wrist. It's a slap in your pocket. And so that's what we're working on. The BEC meets the third Wednesday of every month. From 1:00 to 3:00 it's open to people. But they're doing it by Zoom now because of COVID.

Well, I'll tell you why I ask that question. I believe that we need to have things that are passed down. We need some generational wealth. We need to be secure. And what we get we need to be able to keep it. We need to have something that can't be taken away from us. Like, if we get housing and we buy these houses in the community, I'm concerned about somebody coming in and offering somebody three or four times what their house is worth so that they can blockbust the community. And pretty much like Priscilla was saying with gentrification, when they want it they just come back and take it. We need some protection against that. And, the equality part of that is that it needs to be in the communities of color. Like I said, I live in what's called the West End. It's right next to North End with the Italians. Their equity is passed down through their families, their generations. They keep theirs. So, I worked at Unity Bank back in the day in the 70s and I watched money flowing through Boston. And we had opportunities then for equity. It's about education. We're not educating our young people to say, okay, we don't need those Jordan sneakers, we don't need this that and the other, we need stuff that we're going to be able to pass down to generations. We're going to leave a legacy. So, that's with my issue. That's my experience that has led me to this. I'd watched people just lose everything, and get pushed out. That's my experience. That's my concern, and that's what I want to be able to jump in the fight with and for. Thank you.\",\n",

They come in our communities, they campaign, and they promise stuff. We don't see the changes. They know what we need. It's not like they don't know what we need. I'll give you a perfect example. Mass Cass. Now, we have this city that is spreading. It's spreading almost like a disease on your skin. You know what I mean? They saw this coming. They've seen it in other cities, and they knew when there was I think 25 tents down there. They saw that. They knew it. They didn't address it. They said they knew there was a problem and they were going to create committees to explore, and they have all these different phrases and things that they use when they want to back you up off of them. So, there's over 200 now. There's a rat infestation there. The community down that way cannot continue to operate. The food pantry is down there. The big food pantry for Boston is down there. It's unsafe. You have people down there who are mentally ill. They're not responsible. So, people seen this coming. I've heard so much [inaudible] about it. Everybody has their take on it but nobody's doing anything about it. Now, and even with the ones that are running for mayor, it comes up in every conversation just about. They knew that it was there. These people didn't just fall off the chicken truck. They have been in the position to do something about that all the time. They have been in political positions, all of them, and especially these two that are running. So they knew. So when Oanh was talking about holding people accountable to their promises, we don't want to just hear you say what we want to hear at the time and get our votes. My vote is very important. I came from the generation where I heard about the stories about them closing down the polls. My mother and my aunts and uncles and all of them, it wasn't safe. They would burn down your house and kill your whole family. Lynch you in public so that it would deter the other people from stepping up and wanting to vote or wanting to be an advocate for voting. So, my vote is very important. We do need to hold these people accountable. When we don't see something being done when there's a promise that you made, and this is an age old issue.

Hoping that they can hear our voices, and hoping to see things happen instead of seeing all of that is just like empty promises and the feeling of being used. And I think, at the end of the day that's the feeling that we would hate to have, is the feeling of being manipulated by someone, or being used for their own personal agenda, versus, trying to identify the real problems and coming up with real solutions. And I think that's where we can all relate. Doesn't matter what our background is.

       "  'words': \"Sure. Yeah, me too. So I think I resonate a lot with many of us that already spoken. The big thing is that all of us have our own experience with our personal story. But I think the problem was that it happen very subtle in the system. Nobody talk to nobody. They just want in their own bubble. So, it's really hard to have that across sector collaboration to ensure that would be across the board, because we know that we all have scarce resourcing and we all try to fight for the pie, but not [inaudible] and collaborate, not working together in that context. And then not really involve those who have this experience to be part of that decision making and policy revising or practices that we should be designing as a city or as the officer to be able to do that. So I think a lot of this would be... so if I should go back into the questions, whether or not... how we can hold, that Nan already mentioned, officers accountable in the work that they do? But the big thing for me in terms of how can we ensure that everything is interconnected, and how can we leverage that collaboration, partnership? And a lot of that has to come from cross work community. And I think the bigger thing would be the budget and funding. Budget and funding have not been equitably distributed across all different sectors. Some who might have more of a voice, some who might be able to speak up and speak out, those are the one who always receive the most. However, there's so many different other community day agency or faith-based agency who do the good job who really out in the community and a lot of them also doing from their heart with the husband, but the officers doesn't [inaudible]. They don't really pay attention to this cross work community. The question go back, we have, some of us already mentioned, in terms of the needs for the elders, the needs for the school, the needs for [inaudible], the need for education and all of that, it's all connected. And even with the wealth, that whole racism thing is another big thing that I don't think we have enough time to talk, but the collaboration and having those who have[inaudible] experience.

I mean, some of these people that are running have been operating like this for years. So we need to let them know that we pay a salary. You\\'re supposed to represent us. And if you continue to operate like this then we are going to remove you. However, we need everybody. We need the blacks. We need the Latinos. We need the Asian. We need the white folks. We need everybody to be saying the same thing to these elected officials because we get it. We know we don\\'t get the services because we don\\'t come out and vote. And that\\'s insane that we continue to ride our bumpy roads, that we continue that we\\'re the last ones getting our trash dump. We can\\'t go through the process of signing up with the City as a vendor for procurement because their process is so long and intimidating that we can\\'t get through it. We don\\'t have organizations that help us with our back office stuff, either be it nonprofit or whether it be a construction worker. We have a lot of construction workers, they have their own businesses, but they don\\'t know how to do the back office stuff. They don\\'t know how to bid on their projects. So they under bid and they don\\'t make any money. I mean, I\\'ve seen so much. And I\\'m telling you, that\\'s what makes me fight and talk the way I do, because I\\'ve seen it. I\\'ve been in it. And I\\'m tired of it because it\\'s so unfair. I\\'ve been in banking. I worked for the Mass Affordable Housing Alliance helping folks with their first time home buying. Remember when we all got Red Line? I mean, the system continues and continues to beat us down. And who runs the system? White men. Because you have all these white men that are in government that now Washington\\'s been shook up because there\\'s a lot of women coming in, women of color, and that\\'s what we need to do. We need to not only look at the City but we need to look at the state of Massachusetts, because we are getting ready to get a governor next year. There\\'s going to be redistricting, so there\\'s going to be seats up for running. And that\\'s what we need to have. We need to have people that look like us, reflect the synergism and the legislators. Governor Baker doesn\\'t even have a black person on his cabinet. So how are they representing us when he don\\'t even have nobody like us on his cabinet. These are the things that we need to be questioning and then asking them. I asked Michelle Wu, \"Is your cabinet going to look like the people that you serve?\" Because we don\\'t want to go backwards. We want to go forward. I\\'m very passionate about this stuff.

       "  'words': 'I\\'d like to piggyback off that what Priscilla was saying about holding accountable. The thing that... I\\'ve been doing civic engagement, voter registration for years. And the thing that really hurts me most is a person say, \"Why should I vote? My vote don\\'t count.\" And I look and I\\'ve been saying, \"Yes, it\\'s good to register, but you need to educate these people.\" Just because you register them, it doesn\\'t mean they\\'re going to vote. You need to register them and then follow them, whichever way. Like MassVOTE is one of them that really gets out to other organizations to help with that and I\\'ve been doing phone banking for years and the Get Out The Vote issue. And, we need to hold elected officials accountable. That\\'s how I got a lot of things done in the [A-leagues 01:04:00]. I knew from the governor, except for Baker, all the governors down and the mayors, and even though we only had one for 20 years and then... but anyway, I knew him, and the city councils, right? But, it\\'s a matter of you letting them know you\\'re not going to just sit back and let them do what they want, because I would tell them quick, \"I voted you in, I\\'ll vote you out, or I\\'ll run for your office.\" But, even though I\\'ll never do that. But it\\'s just, I\\'m serious, we start with our kids now and then, well, we have to start with the older ones. I\\'m a senior. I live in a senior housing, right? And, I don\\'t think half of the seniors in here are registered to vote. But I know the ones are, it\\'s a strong group. But, we need all of the elders to... Well, we\\'re powerful and everybody know seniors go and vote before anybody else. It\\'s a matter of holding them accountable. And like I\\'m a lifetime member of the NAACP, and I would go to the conventions, right? And what they do in Washington, they have a report card for everybody in Washington. This is the NAACP national. And I\\'ve been saying, \"We need to do that in state, especially Massachusetts.\" We need to see what bills they\\'re passing, which ones they\\'re not supporting, and have a record of that, and have it where it\\'s somewhere online or somewhere that the community could go and look at it and form their own opinions, because I think we need to stop telling people who to vote for. We need to tell them you go do your own research and find out. Don\\'t vote for someone because Sarah said you could vote for them. I heard people say, \"Well, Sarah, don\\'t tell them this because they\\'ll go back and say Sarah told me to do this.\" So, [inaudible]. But that\\'s my opinion. And that\\'s why I really believe in the voter registration, voter education. Like with my kids, when they turned 18, my nieces and nephews, I would do a voter registration event for all of them that turned 18. And I told my kids, \"You better not come back in the house unless you voted.\" So, these are the things we need to do. If we\\'re not doing it, we need to do it and tell our neighbors and family members to do the same thing.',\n",

The drugs, the guns, they don't have that in Wellesley. They don't have... and it wouldn't happen in Newton. You know what I mean, and all this other stuff? So it's been pipelined. It's targeted. I'm real passionate about this too. But when you do that to a community it's not just the young people that are affected, everybody is affected. You have grandmothers who are being evicted because of things that are happening in... We need to find out how we can stop this? How do we stop our communities from this? What are those other communities doing that's keeping it out of their communities? There's no gun manufacturers in Roxbury. There's no poppy fields in Roxbury, Dorchester. Those drugs are coming in, and they're being pipelined directly. This is targeted. So, we need to trace it back. How can we stop it at source? So, that's one thing because, it does affect the safety of the seniors. We're easy targets, and it's tough. We have things that spring up like Mass and Cass. This is just... I came through there the other day when I was coming from Best Buy, trying to get robbed for my computer issues, and when the taxi turned the corner, it was like we came into a different planet. I looked on both sides... I haven't been down there because it used to be that when you came off of the highway you could see that it wasn't a...

And the second dot is supposed to be the politicians or government leaders. And the third dot is for business owners. Because it\\'s entirely up to us to identify problems in our every day life.

So that is what I would like to propose from listening to everybody is doing is that we need solidarity. We need unity. We need to have the voice. We need to amplify the voice from the Cass Road community.\",\n",

I know that my grandfather, who came from Barbados, in the early 1900s, bought a house on [Stromard] Avenue, and was gentrified out, in the 1980s. After having a house, well, it was his daughter, my mother, who actually received the house after he passed away, but she was gentrified out because it became unaffordable for her to live there, because of taxes. Now it\\'s a multimillion dollar home, on the corner of Stromard and Massachusetts Avenue. As I said, five generations of Rocks have lived over and impacted in that house, and unfortunately, it\\'s gone now. That\\'s the, I think, the collective experience of Black folks in Boston, being pushed out from one neighborhood to another. The impact is great, it\\'s an emotional strain. In many ways, I\\'m not sure about this whole issue about a conversation. I think it\\'s overstated, about conversations. Because we\\'ve been having conversations for years, about gentrification. In fact, Collins and Kevin White and others, already had a master plan for Boston, and that has been in the making for, now, close to 100 years. So when people say, \"Let\\'s have a conversation,\" have a conversation with who? There was a group back... And I know all of you all can relate to this, is that there was a group back in the day, called The Vault, and The Vault made the decisions, regarding what happened; politically, economically, socially, morally, and everything else, in the City of Boston.

Why do I put that on the conversation, is because school desegregation happened in 1974, began in 1974, nothing has changed in Boston. I just read, in the Boston Globe yesterday, that Black teachers hardly exist in Boston anymore. So all that work that Judge [Garrity] did, to actually call for a one on one hiring, and to bring up the level of Black teachers, to be at the same level of the population of students, which was at the time around 23, 24%, everything has changed and nothing has changed in Boston, in terms of educational opportunity for Black folks. And I'm going to put in people of color, and I'm going to talk about poor Whites too, that their parents jumped and ran and moved out, but some weren't able to move out, and they're still there, and the kids are getting the same lack of educational opportunities.

And if Black folks aren\\'t coming out to vote, and if people that are running for election are not motivating folks to get out and vote, both in their conversations, speeches about what they plan to do, what plans they have, then the status quo is going to be the status quo. And the bottom line is, those that do vote, should actually coil all this together, and have those conversations with the body politicians, to essentially say, \"Guess what? When a developer comes in and wants to develop on public land owned by the city, and they want federal or state, or city tax credits, you don\\'t get them unless we come up with a plan to make sure that there\\'s packages of housing, for one, two, three, four, five room housing.\" Because you know, Black families and Latino families are large. But they\\'re making apartment buildings with one bedrooms and efficiencies, so that automatically forces people out, particularly those that can\\'t afford that market rate housing. So if there\\'s no strategy to make sure that the developers and the city, is requiring a certain number of properties made out for families... But there\\'s not that conversation in the city, at all. None of the politicians are talking that language. To me, conversation just for pretty conversation, is nothing.

A Black agenda, unapologetically Black, not people of color, but a framework that had smart measures that were specific measurable, attainable, and had time sensitive markers. A report card with the NAACP, and they talked about... And subsequent to that, they got everybody's emails and phone numbers, and we broke up into break out groups, and we've been having conversations and even Senator Wilkerson, who does the Wakanda, who was instrumental in getting Rachael Rollins elected, and tried to endorse Janie, they have subsequently, or I think on today, are going to veer that framework that they came up with, that they are endorsing Wu.

I have been to a lot of these meetings that you're talking about, as well as Pastor Reyes talked about, and maybe I am naïve, but I do think that having different conversations... And State Representative Nika Elugardo, she was instrumental in really being able to help again, to create this framework that's not endorsing a candidate, but has an agenda and metrics, that is a Black agenda, that we will hold accountable to whomever that elected mayor is, in the City of Boston.\",\n",

When I say that, there is nothing in Boston, like it was before. For our children, there're no centers, there're no activities. There's nothing to make them feel like they belong to the city of Boston. We have to fight so how for them. My experience in my life goes back to my three sons. I was a single mother and I was raising three sons, and all I heard all through their lives was statistics, crime. You know they're not going to be this, they are not going to be that. You know people were putting them down, their peer people were putting them down as a young African American child. Schools, Community Centers. Just people that they looked up too. So, that led me to fight for them. To travel with them. To make sure that they're okay. To make sure that they earn and get what they need to get out of Boston as I did for a child that my mother gave me. I wanted them to believe in their selves that they can accomplish anything in life. They could do anything they want in life. Nothing, no word, no action could take place in theirs lives that would stop them. That just made me get more into their education. It made me follow through their education, until I made sure that they were okay to able to stand up and finish the rest of their lives as men. To not be statistics, not go to jail, not do this, not do that. The city of Boston has to understand that it is all about our children. We have lived our lives, we have done everything in our lives, and we have a lot of children here that are suffering and can not get the quality lives that we already had, and it's not fair to them. So, my mission is to fight for our children. My place in Boston in the future, I want to have the biggest organization for the children because they have so much talent, and so much to offer, and I want to be a voice for them. I want to carry their voices on my back, and once we get where we are going I want to take them off my back and put them in front of me and make sure that they are able to talk as loud as they can and accomplish everything they can. My sons made it. They made it, and each child every single day that I encounter with, they are going to make it because they are very special. They are very unique, and they have a purpose in Boston.

       "  'words': \"Okay, Roxanne and Galaxy. Well, I can identify with what they are really saying about the homelessness, and about Mass Ave. I work in that area and it has never been like that, and it is really sad that people are not taking the heat to what's really going on. These are human beings and they do have problems that we all have. Some of us can come up out of it, and some of us can not. They are homeless, but they are allowing them to live in the street, and not giving them the stuff that they need in order to get well. I work in that area, and I see the tents, I walk by the tents. I feed the hungry at my job. The hungry, I mean I feed families at my job where I'm at. Every morning when I go there at 6:30. In the park, all I see is a lot of tents. They are beautiful people. I talk to them, and when you look at them and you hear their story. As small as a mustard seed of what happened to them, and all they are asking for is help. Basically the city should be ashamed of themselves in that we have a big population of the homeless that's in Boston. Now, back in the day, I had a sister that was out there too. It was a long time ago, and a sister is someone that you really love and you really want to do what you can, but you can never understand her situation. So I feel really bad for them, because they do have families like my sister did. But that is what she chose to do. Just like the both of you said, we need to help. That should be number one of every ones list, to try to get help for these young men and young women. That's part of homelessness, and Boston has never been like that before. It's okay. One quick thing, I think that... I think that, we are all on here today, they need people like us to help absolve this homeless problem. We could be homeless in a minute, just like Mrs. Webb said. We can, but we have the tools to help these people. We are sitting in our homes, we are looking at the news and we are trying to understand what's going on, and we got the answer here, but we can't voice our opinions. So I do feel for Mrs. Webb because she was homeless for a minute, but she thought about her children, and she didn't think about herself. I feel what Gray and Galaxy are saying about the homeless, and I do applaud them, I really do. For thinking that way, I really do.\",\n",

We weren\\'t ready for what\\'s going to happen when we came out of our homes. So, I sit a lot and I think how I had to change my life, for me. In order to make it better for me. In order for me to see the outcome of what Boston has lost, what Boston is changing without us. What Boston has done to us as individuals. You\\'re absolutely right. They have taken, and still are taking a lot of things from us, but it is up to us to change our ways. Change differently, find ways to change. Listen, I had talked to some families, and I want to say here what these families were saying, right? My question to them were, I hear everybody, I understand and I really do, and it has happened in my life too. But, one question I wanted to ask them, are you all ready, and they said, \"ready for what\"? I said, \"do you have your first aid kit, have you taught your child safety if something has happened in your home, a safe place.\" \"Have you taught your family CPR.\" Those are the things we need to worry about right now, hunger, food in our homes, stocking food. Teaching our children how to survive out here. Don\\'t worry about what the outside world is doing. That\\'s what they want us to do. In the meantime, are we getting ourselves together in our homes.

You don't find eggs, and people are getting these extra stamps. Basically because the food went high, and that's everywhere. It doesn't matter what supermarket you're shopping at.

And it creates tension in the home because these parents are trying to live vicariously through them. And they yelling at them, being that parent that's yelling from the stands, wanting them to be a certain way. And these kids, their heart is not in it.

I was a part of gangs, I've hurt my community, I didn't understand that I was not competing economically and I was not headed towards helping my brothers and sisters in my community in Roxbury, get where they needed to go by playing small. The other thing is when I was in the Dearborn, some other high schools that I went to, I can only remember less than a handful of black teachers. I seen paras and things of that nature, but even now when I'm... I had a meeting with a grade level team over at Dearborn the other week and the entire staff on the ninth grade were women. No, no, sorry. I'm sorry. Seventh grade was all white women and they were excited to have BAM there and my judgment is because I am a black male. I mean, they struggle with understanding how to teach our young men and I think that's very important. Visionary perceptions and the images that young men have just with teachers and mentors and professionals coming in these school buildings, teaching on financial literacy and so forth and people volunteering their time to mentor our youth. I think that will have a great impact on how we level the playing field economically in the future. And with that I'm in.\",\n",

       "  'words': 'This is Janet. I agree with Soraya about taking her granddaughter to the clinic and stuff and how I really can relate to everyone. And we\\'re just at these moments now, where it\\'s like these are things that we have to be concerned about. Because, I feel like a 12 year old can\\'t even make decisions for themselves, so they shouldn\\'t be able to go into the doctors and be in there by their self. I guess they\\'re trying to do privacy and stuff, but 12 years old, there ain\\'t no privacy. When I was 12, I didn\\'t have no privacy, when I was 12, I couldn\\'t go to the doctors and tell the doctors whatever I wanted to tell them and tell my grandmother to sit out in the waiting room. That wasn\\'t happening. So, I feel like us as parents and grandparents, we have to get back to our roots, because when children were raised the way I was raised, I didn\\'t like being told what to do and stuff and like that, but it made me who I am today and that made me a great person, because I had structure. My grandmother played out with us. We would get in trouble for stuff. Discipline was very popular in our household. And now it\\'s like people are telling the people they can\\'t discipline the children anymore. That\\'s making the kids feel like they\\'ve got the power. Growing up I didn\\'t have no power. My grandmother told us something and that was it. And then moving forward to the housing, there\\'s no rent control. Every year my rent is going up and I don\\'t understand that, because it just doesn\\'t make sense to me. The people can just keep raising the rent, raising the rent, housing authorities telling you, \"Oh, there\\'s nothing we can do, we\\'re only going to pay you this amount. Or you\\'re going to have to find somewhere else to live.\" And then it\\'s like trying to find somewhere else to live is like pulling teeth out of somebody\\'s head with no Novocaine. It\\'s like my voucher is for this much, people aren\\'t even accepting this price anymore for housing. It\\'s ridiculous. And then as far as the homeless people in the world right now, it\\'s getting cold outside and I really feel for them, because right now it\\'s freezing. And what are we supposed to do. Yes, we\\'re complaining about rent control and housing and stuff. We\\'ve got a roof over our head. At the same time, someone else doesn\\'t. And that hurts me, but I still have concerns as a resident also. And as far as April, as far as the people building condos and housing everywhere. That\\'s concerning too, because it\\'s like okay, what are we going to do. We just wait our turn to be pushed out? Or what are they going to tell us? We\\'ve got to go? I don\\'t know how that works. A lot of things now are different. Before, we didn\\'t have to worry about these things. Even the pandemic. Even Covid, Delta, our children are growing up in different times now. We never had remote learning, we went and got our butt up and went to school.',\n",

And it\\'s complicated like someone said, the world is so divided, but at the same time, we do need to be more, I agree with being more involved in the kids\\' schools because you don\\'t know what\\'s going on over there. My son is five years old and I went to the school. They had a meeting with me, because he has autism. He was pulling his pants down and urinating on the floor. So, I\\'m like, \"Okay, that doesn\\'t sound right, because when he\\'s at home he is not doing it, he goes to the bathroom and he wears underwear.\" So, for school I didn\\'t feel comfortable just putting him out in school in underwear so I sent him in pull ups. And they were all like, \"He needs to be in underwear since he wears underwear at home, he should be in underwear at school.\" I was like, \"I don\\'t think that\\'s a good idea.\" Because, I think it\\'s too fast. He is not familiar with his surroundings yet, he doesn\\'t know. But people don\\'t think that we know our children and that we don\\'t know what\\'s best for them, because they have degrees and these things and that they know better than we do, but if we\\'ve been with our children ever since they\\'ve been born. We know our child more than anyone else can think that they know them. So, I did what they said and I put him in underwear and I sent him to the school. And I set my son up for failure, because then he\\'s in an uncomfortable situation. He doesn\\'t know if this is comfortable for him or not. So, he ended up pulling his pants down and stuff. So, then they ended up wanting to have a meeting with me. So, I ended up having the meeting with them. And then I\\'m like, \"Let me see what this bathroom looks like, let me see.\" Because, my son has a problem with using public restroom, so I go in the bathroom and I walk into the classroom and the classroom is so depressing. As soon as I went in the class, it was a whole depression came over me or something. It was dark in the class. I forgot where I was at. And I\\'m like, \"Damn, open up some of the windows, the shades and stuff, why is it so dark in here?\" And so I walked into the bathroom to see if he\\'ll go and the bathroom was so dark and scary. It looked like it was a dungeon or something. I\\'m like, \"No wonder why these kids is in here acting up, they\\'re in a developmental class and it\\'s depressing as hell in here. Come on. No wonder why they\\'re acting up. Open up the damn shades. Put the light on in the bathroom. God said let there be light, come on. Get it together in here.\" I\\'m like, \"Oh my god, I didn\\'t even know.\" I felt something as soon as I went in there and I was uncomfortable. And I didn\\'t like that so I took my son home for the day, because as soon as I went back in the room to talk with the teacher and then they said my son was knocking shelves off of the wall. So, I\\'m like, \"Yeah, you\\'re going home for the rest of the day.\" They were trying to kick him out of school. So now guess what, since I put the pull ups back on and send him to school, now it\\'s okay for him to stay at the school. I don\\'t know. Thank you. I don\\'t know.',\n",

It's like everyone is so sheltered, everyone just stays to themselves. No one is talking to anyone, it's like you see something, say something, it's like everybody is minding their own business. They don't want their kids, even pre pandemic, playing with your kids. It's divided. I don't know if it's just systemic racism, because it's a predominantly Dominican community or whatever, with a couple of blacks, Asians, but it's really sad, because I miss that growing up as a kid, where they say it takes a village to raise a child and everyone looked out for other people's kids and their safety and wellbeing.

At the same time, it\\'s I think people are afraid. People are afraid to say anything now as far as like, how it takes a village to raise a child. People are scared. People are afraid. It\\'s not like you see a lot of friendly faces anymore, you see people, they\\'re like, \"Ra.\" So, it\\'s like you\\'ll just be scared. People are not really sensitive anymore. A lot of people are just cold and bitter now. I don\\'t know, I remember growing up I\\'ve seen a whole bunch of jolly faces, happy people. People were happy. People were content with who they were and they were just, they just loved everyone. My grandmother, she raised us and stuff. And we was in a three family house and stuff on Crawford Street. That\\'s where we grew up at, in Grove Hall. And everybody knew everybody. Everybody just knew everybody and it was good. Now it\\'s like everybody is divided. They don\\'t want to know nobody and that makes you scared. I\\'m not going to trust somebody with my child that don\\'t look too friendly. So, it\\'s just everybody is divided, everybody is all about self. And then they wonder why these kids are out here shooting each other. These kids are out here getting into all of this stuff, probably because they can\\'t relate to their own people and their own house. They need someone else to talk to. Maybe someone else, if you can\\'t get them on the right track, maybe someone else can. That\\'s how it was. If I couldn\\'t talk to my mom about something, I had my aunt. If I couldn\\'t talk to my aunt about something, I had my other aunt or my uncle, I always had someone I could go to and talk to. And now, it\\'s like I have my own children, I have a 19 year old daughter, I have an 11 year old daughter and I have a five year old son. And I\\'m paranoid to send them with anyone, because of all the things that happen in the world. You want to trust, you really do, but you don\\'t want your kids to be in a situation that you could\\'ve had control over, but you didn\\'t. Because, then they resent you after, \"You put me in the situation.\" So now, it\\'s like electronics is controlling the kids. Any damn way. Electronics. Electronics. Their phones. Their iPad. Tablet, whatever. We didn\\'t have that growing up. These kids have got social media, Facebook, all the things. What did we used to have? My Space. I think I was 16, 17 at that point, but it\\'s just not the same.',\n",

It's not an easy thing to go through. A lot of my experience with dealing with that situation too, is it's a dangerous situation when you go in that area. I went down to the McDonald's one day and I was, basically, accosted from the time I tried to place my order, to the window I went to pay for it, to the window I went to pick up my stuff. There was a person from Methadone Mile, a homeless person, that was at my car at each one of those stops. So it was a very scary thing to go through and I don't wish that on anybody because I was really nervous. And then I saw a security guard come around and get them off from around the McDonald's and the area. But it's a very scary experience, but it's a reality that those people are living every day and I think that there should be more done to be able to get those people off the street and the mental health that they need.\",\n",

I live in subsidized housing and I have told people on more than one occasion, especially throughout this pandemic, that people don't know that there's a whole lot of invisible, poor people right in this very affluent neighborhood. But I think, as it relates to my questions earlier, housing is a fundamental right. It should be like... And it's a social justice issue. It's a human rights issue and if we have all of this room to build million-dollar McMansions in Dorchester and billion-dollar skyscrapers and high-rises that are sitting empty, we definitely have the ability to build more affordable housing. I saw an article yesterday that the BPDA, which is the Boston Planning and Development Association, I think, they approved something like 940 units of housing for the city of Boston. 172 of those units are listed as affordable. And affordable is a misnomer. We have way more people who are living down in... closer to the extremely low income level in this city, who cannot find housing because it is so ridiculous. But housing-affordable goes all the way up to, in some neighborhoods, $120,000 a year. That is insane. A person who is making $20,000 a year cannot compete in the same market as a person who is making $120,000 a year. And so... But both of those people would qualify for affordable housing in Boston, as it is now. And so those two things really... That really resonated for me, is the housing issue and the lack of affordable housing for people in actual brackets that represent the incomes of the people who need the housing.\",\n",

       "  'words': \"All right. So this is David. I think when... I think it's Pamela that was talking about housing and how she grew up here and over the years has seen a transformation, or what we would call gentrification now. And I think it's a real need. I wasn't born here, so I don't know anything about that, but I have read so much to understand that it's a reality. And so, having spent the last, like I said, spent the last 13 years now, in Boston, I think I could, to a large extent, say I have seen it, but also I have listened to many stories. It resonates with me and I think too, to that point, is that having conversations like this and making sure that folks like Pamela, and many others who have lived here, do not leave here to go to Brockton or go to another place, it's real. And so we need to fight together. It is, whether you are new to Boston or just coming to Boston yesterday, or even arrive in Boston today, the conversation should be ongoing. I think too, and then to Kelly's point with the mental crisis, anytime I drive past the Methadone Miles I weep for this country. One, I know I'm a Nigerian, so in case you're wondering who did this, so keep talking, and I've traveled around the world to know when I see [inaudible], it baffles me that we live in a country with so much abundance and yet people are dying. It's... I just can't understand what's happening, but yet it feels like this happened in my country. It's going to be all over the world that Nigeria is blah, blah, blah. All of those African countries are black, but yet if I could take pictures and show it to my folks in Nigeria, they will laugh at me. But anyway, that's a different conversation. So I say that this is a reality, and we have to do that together, irrespective of where we come from. Whether you're old or new, it's a fight that we have to do and I think, like I said, I'm also coming from a spiritual... Today's kind of a day that the Lord has made. But I remember this, just this in regards to the Old Testament, sorry, I'm going to go a little bit fate, where the Bible talks about even those that are poor, the rich, when they go to glean their land, the Bible tells us that they allow, they don't glean everything, they allow for the poor. But we don't see that happen now. What we see is the people who claim everything and the poor doesn't have opportunity to glean behind them. And so when people go to harvest, what I'm saying is that they leave something for the poor. And what we're seeing is that the rich, [inaudible] goes grab everything is that's there. They grab as much as they could. They could even clear everything so the poor doesn't have anything on the street. And that's the result of what we see happen here. And so that's one story that resonates with me. And, like I said, I'm here. Part of the rules, it goes to tie to my own passion of seeing young people, that they don't have to live like their parents. I've got two boys and this is a fight that I have to do for them. Mm-hmm (affirmative).\",\n",

So passion, determination, and then that, what I would call righteous anger, where they are angry about something and they want to see change. Until you get to that righteous anger, change won't happen, and so that's all the things I'm hearing.\",\n",

I feel like my experience of living in Boston, I worked at a soup kitchen in the south end of Boston for about three years and now I'm a teacher, and I've grown more aware of how segregated the city of Boston is along racial and economic lines and how Boston can be kind of a cold place. The weather is cold. There's a very long winter in Boston and because of the history of the city. And I think the ways that people are habituated to move through it and go to work and then come home, it doesn't feel like a city of joy. And it certainly doesn't feel like a city of justice where we've really reconciled with white supremacy and the rule of a wealthy rule and class.

And so the work that I do now is about educating other Latinos that you can come home to the indigenous roots of our people, but you have to do it in a respectful way, that's about being authentic, and genuine, and honest about how we were really raised, outside of our traditions and our lands. And one of the things that is so important that I've learned over the course of doing this work is to listen to native raised native communities and nations about what they think is really going to solve... No, solve is the wrong word. But that what's really going to help native people? And I think everyone's really concerned about climate and the future. And native communities have a lot of knowledge and wisdom about that, and are very much outside of capitalism. So there's just a way that I think people want to kind of keep the system the way that it is now and think that they can still solve climate change. I don't think that that's possible, I don't think that they're compatible. And so I just wonder about, I know that is a big issue for the new mayor, and I'm just wondering about what she thinks about it.

And I was thinking a lot about inequality, which is definitely highlighted there. And then I was reading lots of articles about Boston and the issues people were facing. And I wanted to know about my specific area, I was moving into this Brighton and Allston area. And I guess what my role would be and what my place would be moving in here? I was reading a lot about gentrification and how these colleges and universities that are here are causing a lot of the problem, because people get big jobs with big salaries and then they stay here and then they cause the cost of rentals to rise. And also, just there\\'s so many students, so the demand is so high. And yeah, all these issues. But for me, my sister, I\\'m from Pennsylvania, so she lives by Philadelphia and for a very nice new, renovated apartment, Philadelphia is not cheap. I don\\'t know, the prices aren\\'t even comparable to like a little apartment here in Brighton, which is just interesting. And I think that for some, while at the same time, as some colleges and universities, they\\'re causing these issues. But I think that students can afford to live in these situations and pay the prices and that\\'s causing the costs to rise. But I feel like with my PhD stipend, it\\'s very low. And I\\'m from a low SES family. And my parents can\\'t afford to help me, which I know is happening for some other students in my program. So it\\'s definitely really a struggle just to make ends meet and meet my rent. And when I was choosing programs and comparing them, I was talking to people who live here for a while, like the faculty and students and things like that. And a big thing they said was, \"We can\\'t change it, but this stipend is really hard to live on, especially with the cost of living in Boston, how high it is. And we\\'re not going to lie to you, this is just how it is.\" So, that was something I knew coming in. But yeah, I guess as I\\'m looking for apartments for next year and things like that, it\\'s just something that\\'s been on my mind.',\n",

Then I had a disability, as I was talking a little earlier and stopped me from being a workaholic, I have a master's degree. And also, I do holistic as well too. So I do many different things. And being single, being Asian, first generation, is very. Being a struggle, I move in different towns in Boston. I'm reaching for Brookline and now I'm in Allston. But Brookline, I still consider Brookline and stuff. So that's why I was hesitant to say anything about where I live, because different towns are slightly different. I worked in different towns as a case manager too. So I know how it is working with families [inaudible]. I was a case manager at the DCF and all that. So I had that experience working with them and knowing that, and me now living here, it's totally different, even though it's a town over. So that's why I have many different skills and jobs just to survive, especially on your own, doing it. And just continue doing it and continue education, times change. But it's very difficult and it's yeah, it's very difficult, especially a woman and being minority, they still see that and there's still stereotypes. What you should do, what you shouldn't do and being first generation is very difficult because everyone in my family's married and have kids and I'm single, much later in life than everyone here. Even though I might look young, I have the energy more of younger stuff. I have more energy earlier, it's more a quiet time. Yeah, so it's a very difficult and being disabled somewhat, I can say right now, it's a struggle because I don't get benefits. The disabled person to have stereotype. I have to still work really hard and justify if I do get anything, every year's review. So it's a very hard struggle doing that, on top of you were struggling early trying to make a living here, buying a place on your own and stuff. And not getting much help, being single, is not nice because people have kids, they get all these benefits, right? Everyone's to their own, but for me, being single, you don't get benefits. Now, people get benefits and have kids, right? So they have the extra money and stuff coming in, right? Single ones are the ones you see they're struggling working right now with COVID going because they have to. So it's very difficult and it's unfair really. So hopefully that does change and there's more incentive for being single and being happy being single. You don't have to necessarily be married, or a couple, or anything like that. Everyone's to its own, but they should have more benefits to that sense and for minorities, thank you.\",\n",

And then now, I see the whole thing reversing, and it\\'s like, we don\\'t want you out here. You\\'re not coming out here. But now, guess what? We want to be back in the city and we don\\'t want you there. And so, we\\'re going to push you out there where we didn\\'t welcome you years ago. Now we\\'re telling you guys, well, you have to go even though you\\'ve made Boston your home and your home for your kids. And so personally for me, I don\\'t like the idea that someone else has control of my destiny because they have more resources and generational wealth and just privileged to things that I am not privy to and, so that\\'s my personal experience. But, watching that happen all over Boston to people who look like me and seeing how there\\'s always a rally for the next marginalized person, but black people have lived through marginalization in this city for ever, but whenever the next marginalized person comes in they\\'re rallied for, they get resources, and they get the help they need and we\\'re always overlooked and stepped on.

And I think if you look at the history of Boston, just the small history of Boston over the past say maybe even since 19, what are we talking, 60, maybe 1960, so maybe about 60 years and 50 somehow years, if we look at that, we look at the race rights, we look at desegregation, we look at all the things that started, we look at the structures that how desegregation came out of Boston, we look at the people who did that, we look at the communities that came out of... we look at the assassination of Martin Luther King, and then we look at Boston's history of redlining and how they destroyed the West End, and how they then took Roxbury... just everything that's been done here. The things that were done in the South End. I mean, I think one of the things that Markeisha was talking about was the destruction of the West End where Mel King grew up, right? There was three jails there. When they destroyed the West End it had poor Irish, poor Italian, and poor Jews, and poor blacks. By the time it was destroyed and whites were allowed now or those three ethnic groups were now been seen as being white and no longer just ethnic groups of poor Italian, poor Irish, and poor Jew, they are now white, and they were able to leave the black community. And when I grew through the 60s, 70s, and 80s, I can remember smelling burning houses, and I can remember people talking about wetting their roofs so that ember from other houses that were going to be set on fire by people who were never moving back to the neighborhood, and would never sell their property as well, those are the same properties that are now along the Blue Hill half-quarter, all the way from lower Roxbury all the way into Mattapan Square to Milton. So, this has been my experience growing up here in Massachusetts and seeing this, the powers at be, the same structures exist. It's the same story that the queen was talking about, people deciding now that people with color who could only live in Roxbury now can live in Stoughton and Thornton and all these other places, but Roxbury is now the place where they should be.

I've been undocumented for many years and I've also gone through homelessness. And that time, I don't regret any of it or I don't really like to feel bad for myself or anything like that, it's just because I think I gained a lot of wisdom because of the people that I met, and I met a lot of people who are addicted. I met people who are homeless. I'm involved in an organization now that works[inaudible] immigration advocacy. And yes, my personal experience has been I sat in the State Houses when, for example, the bill for driving has come up. I've been in maybe two those hearings and each time you get these super conservative county sheriffs from different areas of Massachusetts, they come in, they say their... yeah, they [inaudible] bigotry in the State House and then the bill never really passes through. I think even as recent in this year, I want to say someone from my own city where I lived many years, I lived in Lynn for most of my time in the U.S., and I met Senator Brandon Creighton many times, and he's someone who has been involved in trying, or more recently, but he's been involved in trying to push for the driving for family legislation, and even from what I can see, the well intention politicians don't get very far here in Massachusetts. And then I guess the other experiences that I've had in terms of just homelessness, it's just, I don't know, it's sad to me just how stratified the socioeconomic situation is in Boston. I mean, it's like night and day. You go to one side of the City and it's just excessive wealth. All these granular stores. And then you go to another side of the city and then you got things like the Methadone Mile and, instead of doing things to actually deal with the mental... and I'm sure there is some, but most of it is not from the government. These are separate organizations that are working to try and heal these populations. But instead you have things like the Boston Police Department doing... I forget the exact name, actually, it came to me, Operation Clean Sweep, things like that. So instead of actually helping these people you're just treating them like criminals. And it's just, yeah, I mean, I guess, that would be my personal experience. I didn't have any personal experience in Boston with the police, but I've had experiences with police in the North Shore area. Like I said, I'm from Lynn. And yeah, I just have... it is sad to realize... I guess something that I've always felt uneasy even before becoming involved in any social activism spaces was just... I mean, just as a minority, and I think many minorities because they went through this, just walking around Boston, for me, I always felt uneasy. It's always very clear that you come to this side of the City and you're not finding your people there, and they don't live there, and the chances are they're going to be very gated either by money or just straight up, what I would say, covert racism, for moving into certain neighborhoods.\",\n",

I remember when COVID hit and there was all this push for rents, stopping evictions, and building more affordable housing, and the City government was like, \"What? We don\\'t have space to build more affordable housing,\" and things like that, which is just a plain lie because Boston is literally constantly under construction, but of course it\\'s for big businesses. But anyway, my point was going to be that I would work in Western Mass and, or more west of Mass and yeah, there is plenty of land. There is plenty of land in Massachusetts. I worked at a property maybe two weeks ago where a giant house, something like several acres, and it had been abandoned for over a decade, just sitting there. And, do they decide, hey, we\\'re going to build housing here? No, because this was the City of Newton. No, actually, no, it\\'s the city of Needham, which is very similar to Newton, which basically is like, we do not want colored people here. This place is for well off white folk. So, is there no land to build affordable housing? No, there\\'s land. They just don\\'t want to build affordable housing for these groups and it\\'s just... I don\\'t know, that\\'s why I said earlier I got to a place of very little hope for Boston and Massachusetts because it\\'s very blatant hypocrisy that happens in the state, which is sad, because you have all these institutions and higher education which are teaching all these supposed principles of more liberal principles and more compassionate philosophies and, well, what does it actually amount to? Not much, as long as I can tell. So...',\n",

And I\\'ve seen a lot of inequality, and a lot of people struggling to survive, and not even having the minimum needs met. And I think gentrification has not been something that has helped either. And I think that there has not been enough help around the Latino community based parts in Boston. And I think with the pandemic we saw that happen a lot. I\\'m a journalist, and so I was able to talk to a lot of people, and to write about a lot of these things. And I had a really rough time realizing how much this community was ignored. And how if it wasn\\'t in English, they just wouldn\\'t know. There were like... Even information was not available to a lot of people, because he wasn\\'t in Spanish. I\\'ve even seen the translations are not even done correctly either. So it\\'s just a bunch of people not even able to realize or understand what was going on. Especially in a time through... For example, when the pandemic it started, it was really hard for people to even know what was happening. And what was the right to do and what was not right to do. And so I felt very much like the community was ignored. And so sometimes I... I guess that\\'s why my question is, is there a future in which communities whose first language is not English, or who struggle with immigration because of how they got here, is there a future for them? And is there space for them? And a lot of them, for example, when it comes to the census, they\\'re to this day terrified to look at it, to answer it, to be like, \"Yes, I\\'m here.\" So there\\'s not a real statistic on which you can say, there\\'s this many people in East Boston or in Chelsea. Of there\\'s this many Latinos here who are this many. People here with this many families, with this many... You don\\'t fully know because a lot of them will not even open the door. Because they\\'re obviously terrified of giving their information, and saying how many people live here or... Which leads to not having enough resources for people who do live there.

And it's interesting to me, Sophia, my family is Italian, and we lived in East Boston. Came through East Boston and it's another generation, and I watched the Italians leave East Boston. And I watched a lot of people from Central America and Latino people come in. My grandmother stayed until her death, but the community changed tremendously. And East Boston has always been a portal for immigration since colonization took hold and was begun. And so it's really interesting, and very truly upsetting to hear your question. And it dovetails with my question, in so far as who is here, and what's going on? I feel like the entire city is becoming corporatized. And my great aunt owns the house that I lived in, and she can't afford to be a landlord. She can't afford the taxes, and the water bill, and the...

And being able to affect market prices through closer to cost of living. And also a decency in humanity and reasonableness, as opposed to maximizing profit. And I think that the culture of developers that took hold in the last 20 years, is transforming the cities in ways that I don't fully understand what the future of the city will be, and who will be living here. So that's my personal experience also in terms of why I feel that way, and it really does distress me. I guess I'm third generation Bostonian in the immigrant lineage. My daughters have lived her, their whole lives, but they're only 12 and 15. And I don't really foresee that we are going to stay Bostonians, which makes me sad. Because concurrent to that, I went to Boston public schools. I know people at every level of the city in terms of public servants within education, at city hall, friends and family, community members. I'm part of my community here in Dorchester as a mother and a parent. And all of these things have tremendous, this is my life. And so not having seized the opportunity to be a homeowner 25, 30 years ago. I just think was rapidly... it's clear to me it's too late. Unless my income changes significantly, which is not to say that's impossible. But as I balance motherhood, and parental responsibilities, and work, which I share in common with every working pay parent to. To ratchet up income to be able to stay here is less likely, if I'm going to maintain that balance, and do a good job as a parent as well. So, these are huge questions having to do with generational presence here in Boston. And listening to Sophia question whether or not the current generation of East Bostonian immigrants has a future here is really a big deal.\",\n",

I got all the resources I got, once I started working at Dorchester Bay, which my daughter was already a year old. So, it\\'s just, we don\\'t get a lot of resources that we should get. We can\\'t have nothing nice, [inaudible] as simple as a street, like I said. Sidewalks are ...

I feel like they treat us like we are not worth anything. Like we can\\'t have a simple, nice street. Or, you see the ... It\\'s just like Methadone Mile, or it smells like trash. I feel like now we smell like New York. New York used to smell way worse than Boston, and now we\\'re just like New York. So, it\\'s just very frustrating.

And the funny thing is, and it is sad, because I was planning to live in Boston until I die because I\\'ve been in Dorchester since 1976. I played right across the street. I live in Phil\\'s Corner, I live in [inaudible] Corner, and I live in Carmen Square. And after I leave, I used to tell ... And this is the sad part. I used to go out state, I used to tell people I live in the best city in the world. They\\'d be like, \"Where?\" \"Dorchester.\" And like, \"Are you serious?\" To me, it is because I love it. I still say it, Boston strong. Yeah. And the reason I say that because I can say I live in [inaudible] store and I not by [inaudible] because I had no other choice, because I was pushed out because I couldn\\'t afford to live in Boston no more. I wish I can live, but however, because what Trayce said resonates with me, because my son will probably have to live ... Like what you call? Pass the wealth to my son, I can\\'t do that in Boston- Not in Boston. ... because I can\\'t afford it. I can\\'t [inaudible] because my son always said you grew up in Wendover Street. Unfortunately, we had to leave and all my family\\'s there. And that\\'s why I was like ... And funny thing that you said, how can we keep our kids in place without having the displacement? Because when you displace yourself, we\\'re not just displacing, it\\'s [crosstalk] the whole family suffers. And that resonated with me.

So we were able to walk around all the different communities and neighborhoods that surround Northeastern, like Roxbury and Dorchester. And we went through all different communities of Boston that I've personally not been to before. And something that was kind of eye opening to me was that I didn't, since I've never been to them before, I didn't really know that they were there. And it was kind of like a very reflective experience because I was wondering why I haven't been to those communities before and why this club that I was participating in thought we would benefit from these walks. And I realized that it is so important to familiarize yourself with the communities that surround you. Especially since the Northeastern campus is kind of, it can be kind of isolating if you don't walk beyond the borders of it, it can feel like its own little isolated place where everything is all students, and all... this one type of community and culture and academic rigor. But you walk just like 10 minutes outside of the campus lines and there's a whole different community and culture at play. So that was something that was very eye-opening to me. And I think that's why I came to that question, because even though I did engage in those neighborhood and community walks, I still want to learn more about it. And I still want to be confident in my familiarity with those communities. And I want to be able to hopefully one day see myself as a part of that community too. Because I would much rather be a part of a community than simply live in a community. And I feel like there's a very big difference with that.

And the impact that it's going to have on future generations being able to actually exist in the city, and as people of color, people of different ethnicities, people of different cultures, it seems like there's a rhetoric that says that everyone is trying to make sure it's inclusive, but there are people who have been here for generations who have been excluded.

Stop gap measures are being put in place, a lot of students come and they are accepted [inaudible] as interns to come and bring their innovative ideas. And some of these ideas are not in the best interest of the people who have to stay here after the young people that came to school here graduate. So people like me end up in positions where we have to clean up messes that were left by people that had no intention of staying in the first place. They came, they made a name for themselves, they went on to bigger and better, or they looked around and saw that they could amass their fortunes elsewhere, easier than here. And we're just left dangling. The city gets a lot of awards, and we're looked at as a very positive place to be. But that's wonderful. But if you can't afford to actually be able to stay in that positive place, you lose your history. The people that know this place, it's like everything becomes new.

I came from southwestern Pennsylvania full of hope and wanting to do great things and to help, and I didn't go home because I felt Boston needed me more than Pennsylvania. And I'm sure, you know, and I wanted to fit in. And I wanted to make a difference. And little by little, as time went by, disillusionment start to set in, to a point where I almost forgot what it was I really wanted to do. And I just had to turn myself around and decide that, yeah, I'm not going to be popular, I'm not going to be accepted a lot of times because money, I realized early on, money is what rules this city. And I was not into capitalism like that. I wanted to really sincerely help people, you know? And I did not equate people and communities with money, per se. And so at a certain point, when I had children, I became fearful because I knew I had to take care of them. And I had things, obligations, and I became fearful. But now the children are grown, I've been at that job for awhile. I'm fearless. And I'm going to speak up. So sometimes the voice that you have at the beginning is much weaker than the one that you establish at the end fighting through to continue to be who you want to be, and to do the things that you want to do for society and for Boston.\",\n",

When I came to this country, not from another state, but from another country, you feel alone. There are not many people like you from your country who speak your language. But if you start in the city where you live, there are social centers, for example, community centers, the school where your kids go, they have potlucks, they have open houses. So you start going to this event and you make friends with the parents and you start going to all the events at the schools, especially if you are... you like to be involved in your kid's school, you go to the event, you talk to the teachers and then little by little, you see that people are not really different. We come from different places, but I think we all share the same goals. We... as a mother, in fact, you meet with mothers and they all want what's good for their kids. They want their kids to go, to be good at school, to be involved in afterschool programs. So because of that, you start making friends and the friends are not always, and not in my case, they were never from my countries. They were people who came to the United States or people from Boston. And then you start, this friendship would last forever. I'm still friend with parents whose kids went to with my sons when they were in elementary school. My kid is in college now. And I still, when I see them in the street, we stop and we talk, and we talk about what our kids are doing, how when they grew up, they are not with us anymore. But I think what EL is doing is great.

But obviously I've been living in Massachusetts for a while and I've been coming to Boston for all of my life.

And so I hope that I eventually gain a lot of momentum in wanting to have my own goals for what I want to help with the city and what I want to do with my career that can help with the city. I'm currently majoring in health science, and hoping to get a master's in public health. So I'm hoping that's something that I can especially practice and apply to Boston. So I'm very happy that both Helen and AB mentioned kind of setting goals and how everyone kind of has their own goals and the more people you talk to, you realize how similar everyone resonates with each other's goals.

That that\\'s all well and good, but this is a city, and I would say as people living in the city, you have to be cautious. There are some people in the city that are not well. There are some people that involve themselves in things, and it takes awhile. Sometimes suddenly you\\'re listening to the opinions and the ideas of other people, and they\\'re just not... you just, just work on yourself. Go inward, work on yourself, work on your intuition. And if your gut, always go with your gut, if your gut tells you, \"Wait a minute, that didn\\'t sound right. That person didn\\'t sound like they were really supportive of my ideas.\" And what I found is, any idea you have that comes from within you, any goal that you set as something that you want to do, you don\\'t let anybody else interfere with that. When people come home, have opinions and want to interfere, you sometimes have to cast that aside, because everyone\\'s different. And we all have an innate ability to preserve ourselves and to reach our goals, especially if those goals are toward the betterment of humanity and the betterment of ourselves, and the betterment of pretty much the universe. So that\\'s my idea and my belief that I\\'ve learned through the years, that sometimes you just have to stay to your course. Stay the course no matter how many naysayers are out there. If you know that what you\\'re trying to do is something that\\'s going to be beneficial to yourself and beneficial to Boston on the whole, don\\'t let people deter you. Just fearlessly forge ahead. There\\'ll be times when you\\'ll have to move slow. There\\'ll be times when you\\'ll have to stop and rest. There\\'ll be times when you have to forge ahead and use that energy that you have to fight through, but you don\\'t let any individual, any organization dictate and mandate and mold you into who need to be. That comes from within you. Okay?',\n",

Sometimes people think that something is happening only to them, but once they talk about it, they find that other people are in the same situation, or people have been through that, but they didn't talk about it. But now, and it's funny, but because of the pandemic and because everything was in Zoom, everything was virtual and people maybe didn't know each other, there was no in-person interaction. People are more open to talk about their problems. So just by listening to people, you feel like, oh, you're not alone in this.

It could be about this whole thing about, if possible, free MBTA riding, you don't have to pay to ride on a T anymore. Access to real services in the city, especially for residents, because sometimes I find that people that are visiting, or people they're from outsiders that move in with the fortune they have, they have that access. The folks that have been here the longest have not even gotten that yet or haven't even received anything as much. It could be maybe they don't know where to reach out to, unless someone usually brings them to the table to show them where it's at or show them where they have to go to, but most people don't know how to ask for help for services they need, because they feel they're not being heard or don't speak their language. My experience has been, as a community organizer, which helped transform my neighborhood and the area, I come from the Upham's Corner area. I was able to work with the businesses, and the community, and really go grassroot to the racial piece of it that really Upham's Corner struggled with, because it's very, very diverse. You had too many gangs in this neighborhood at one time, and it was their own selves. It was all these cousins and family members that were killing each other. Then, with that alone, we were having issues with the way the community looked. Who wants to come up to Upham's Corner and shop? Nobody, because of the way it looks. We needed to improve the facades, and the storefronts, and help the business with those fundings, the storefronts, and rebuild, and cameras, and safety, and things of that nature. Some things were given, like festivals and things of that nature that would bring everybody together, but that helped to camouflage how great the neighborhood was, but yet, it was lacking, because you've got one side, Jones Hill, which is a little uppity, uppity, and it's got a little more bigger houses, and a little more money. You got one side over across towards the Dudley or Quincy area, and it's folks that are just low-income and still struggling to pay the rents. Yet, we found out that a lot of the building owners that were either empty buildings, at that time, all lived in Florida. I found two of them on a golf course in Florida and was able to bring them down to a community ... I would shut down the streets where one would live at and bring the neighborhood together. We found out how diverse the neighborhood was. People from, not only from the color of their skin, but just different backgrounds from different parts of the world. That's when we got to see the richness of this neighborhood, that people just are from so many different places of the world. They didn't realize how the neighborhood had changed so much.\",\n",

We would have community meetings in a building that once stood called the Maxwell House. It was a warehouse. Actually, there was a flea market on the weekends. We used that facility for the neighborhood to come together. We worked very closely with an organization called Dorchester Bay Economic Development Corporation, and another one, which is Dudley DSMI, Dudley Initiative. It was just really just helping to build up our neighborhood, because it was lacking. We were very instrumental in bringing the Kroc Center to life on W Street, which was an eyesore of a lot. The owners were two folks that were older, and they were ready to retire and just give up the land, all the land they had. We bought them out. By that, we were able to get this building put up, which now brings the community together. Through these two organizations, as well, helping us create and build the community, we were able to buy out abandoned buildings, abandoned churches, anything that was abandoned that they can get your hands on, and do affordable housing, because that's the lack. That's one of the things that Boston suffers from is that we cater to the wealthy, but we don't cater to the folks that really were born in this neighborhood, and grew up in this neighborhood, and have got separated because they can't afford to live here. It's a shame that that has happened, but it's realistic. Now- [crosstalk] I'm sorry.\",\n",

I actually celebrated 12 years of being a homeowner this October, 16th- Yeah! Yay! Thank you. It was hard. It was hard.

And so, my home, house as it's home to my parents, well, my father passed away, but my mom and my sister. And we're all in the family. And we feel blessed, but we've all been homeless at one point in our lifetime. And so, it's really... it hits close to home when I drive...

Like today on the news, there was stuff about them trying to give the people on the Methadone Mile totes and all those tents, and this and that. Now, our city was never like that, I was born and raised here, and I just turned 71, there wasn\\'t no Methadone Miles or all of this, so I really believe that the government needs to do more to encourage people to like... put them in a house somewhere where they can gain their independence so they\\'re not sleeping in a tent. Giving them a tote and they\\'re already frustrated, the rents in Boston are ridiculous, so a lot of people became homeless because of that, then the war on drugs, which there really isn\\'t but there\\'s a lot of drugs here so drug people are migrating from other parts of the city and ending up in the middle of Boston. So I care that the government needs to deal with that issue, with this homelessness. Instead of giving these people a tote, give them a room and somewhere to live. I want our future mayors to realize this, you know what I\\'m saying? All that, \"Oh, you can leave your tent, here\\'s a tote, we\\'re not displacing you.\" It\\'s about to be winter, they got plenty of vacant properties, that shelter that used to be on that island with the bridges, correct some of this and give those people a place to live.

Y yo me pregunto: \"Boston es una ciudad que tiene un sinfín de servicios, hospitales, universidades, es una ciudad turística; es una ciudad que tiene un montón de componentes que la hace interesante para vivir y para el turista. Pero ¿adónde cree la ciudad de Boston que va a encontrar mano de obra o la fuerza pujante, que somos la comunidad inmigrante, para tener todas estas escuelas, hospitales o restaurantes en pie? Porque, independientemente que nos movamos para ciudades más lejos o más cómodas, las distancias son grandes y se dificultará esta clase que no podemos pagar una renta, venir a trabajar a Boston. ¿Y por qué le digo esto? Por mi experiencia, yo tengo 20 años viviendo en Boston y en los últimos años para mí ha sido un esfuerzo sobrehumano pagar la renta. Y moverme no es una opción en este momento, porque mi hija depende de una beca, que tiene que vivir en Boston, yo he comenzado un trabajo en la ciudad de Boston. Entonces, moverme de Boston a mí me limita y me quita un montón de oportunidades, pero a la vez, vivir en Boston, con esta crisis que hay de vivienda, me dificulta otras cosas. Entonces, ¿hacia dónde se ve Boston? Se ve sin una fuerza trabajadora como la comunidad inmigrante en un par de futuros con esta gran crisis de vivienda que hay. ¿Qué piensan las autoridades de Boston sobre la crisis de vivienda? Porque todo el mundo se pronuncia, pero el latino a veces cree la gente que va a sobrevivir y no. Hay gente que ahora tiene dos, tres trabajos para pagar la renta. Y no es que estemos pidiendo que nos den nada regalado, no, a nosotros no nos gusta que nos regalen las cosas. Pero sí creo que no se han puesto a pensar que hay una clase trabajadora que no va a poder seguir viviendo en Boston. Y que se oye bonito cuando dicen: \"No, vamos a hacer el control de renta, la vivienda es un problema\". Pero nadie ha hecho nada realmente como para pararla.

Necesitamos el apoyo de las autoridades, porque a veces nos sentimos impotentes, siendo inmigrantes, trabajadores, luchadores; que somos trabajadores esenciales para la economía de este país, pero nos sentimos a veces muy desanimados cuando salimos a la calle a luchar para poder obtener algo que realmente necesitamos y beneficia a todos, que es la licencia de conducir. Y no hemos recibido respuesta hasta ahora, pero seguimos luchando; no nos desanimamos y vamos a seguir hasta que nos aprueben la licencia, hasta que nos den la licencia.

Ahorita viene una construcción grande que se quiere que se desaparezca una parte del Parque Azul, que le llamamos nosotros; y sabemos que cuando vamos a veces en la noche vemos toda la ciudad de Boston, que se ve bella. Y por esto de las construcciones, esto va a desaparecer. Entonces, ¿ese es el futuro que quieren en Boston? No, ¿verdad? Yo creo, al menos yo no quiero ese futuro para Boston. ¿Por qué me llevó a esa pregunta? ¿O por qué me asocié con la pregunta que ustedes hicieron? Porque yo voy un día de estos caminando sobre la calle Lexington a la Marion, a la Meridian, voy viendo que no tenemos ni dónde caminar por esas construcciones que están haciendo. Nosotros, como residentes de East Boston, no hay dónde parquear un carro, porque esta gente que está construyendo tiene toda la calle para ellos. Vienen ellos con mucha fuerza, quitan-- los residentes ponen conos para poder tener su parking, quitan el cono, lo suben a la acera, y ellos ponen sus carros de construcción. Y nosotros que le pagamos a la ciudad, los que tenemos carros o X, pagamos las taxes, ahí pagamos los derechos de la calle también, porque el carro paga unos taxes. Entonces, ¿el futuro de Boston adónde va a estar? No vamos a tener futuro ya, porque lo vemos algo que está desapareciendo lentamente. Podemos estar en reuniones diciéndoles, nos hemos reunido con gente de la ciudad de Boston, dicen: \"Sí, sí\". Pero ellos a nosotros como personas inmigrantes no nos escuchan, nosotros no tenemos ni voz ni mando en este país. Pero sí nos sacan nuestros taxes, sí tenemos que pagar taxes porque no tenemos un social, no nos van a regresar plata. Entonces, ¿ese es el futuro que quieren para Boston? Creo que ahí es donde tenemos que trabajar todos juntos, porque aquí no solo es una persona, aquí somos una comunidad entera. Gracias.',\n",

I was, as I mentioned before, the guns, I work a later shift and I get home sometimes after nine o\\'clock and when I get home after nine o\\'clock, I\\'m concerned with nothing other than coming down from the T station. I\\'m glad the commuter rail is just right up the street from where I live because I take the commuter rail. I no longer take the red line or the buses. I\\'ll get on the commuter rail, go into work, go into the office. I\\'m so concerned when I get out of the office because I work at the C point area which is very safe. There\\'s always tons of people walking around. There\\'s the long wharf and then there\\'s the international, Intercontinental, I\\'m sorry, Hotel so there\\'s always a bunch of tourists around. There\\'s always transit police and police because it\\'s the downtown area so I\\'m not concerned so much walking from my office when it\\'s dark at night, ask the eight o\\'clock to south station. But sometimes when I arrived Blue Hill Labs Station where I get off, there\\'s a big old long platform and a big old long ramp. So what I did was I was, because sometimes people are just sitting there. I don\\'t know, maybe, watching trains but it\\'s late at night, they\\'re just sitting there guys. So what I did was I asked the engineer, I said, \"Look, when you get to Blue Hill Avenue, could you possibly pull closest possible to that ramp?\" And he said, \"You ain\\'t going towards the rebuilt area?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"That\\'s a long platform.\" I said, \"Yes it is.\" And he said, \"That\\'s a long ramp.\" And I said, \"I\\'m glad you know that.\" He said, \"I never know where to stop because some people do when they exit the train, they go towards the Blue Hill Lab but I go towards Cummins Highway because I live on that side.\" And most people it\\'s maybe one or two people they will get off. Me and another woman or me and another guy but there\\'s never more than two or three people that will get off at that stop. So he started pulling close as possible, going towards [inaudible] so I don\\'t have to walk up the long platform to get to the ramp and then walk up the ramp. The ramp is so long, I don\\'t know if anyone has ever taken the commuter rail or has entered that station, but they have benches that you could rest because it\\'s so long. So lately there\\'s been some crazy guys sitting on those benches with their mask on and stuff like and it\\'s kind of scary too. You never know if someone\\'s waiting there, they going to knock you upside your head or when you exit out of the station on Cummins Highway, they\\'re doing construction up there so it\\'s always kind of dark. The trucks and stuff are everywhere. When I\\'m crossing the street I\\'m always feeling nervous because those bike racks are in the way and then it\\'s so dark that if you\\'re walking across, the cars may not be able to see you and you don\\'t know who may be they\\'re waiting with a gun or whatever. I always think about the guys that were shot a few years ago at that barbecue. They\\'re sitting in a car or outside of our car and then the grandmother that was just sitting on her porch and some random shooting or something like that. Where do these... I could be coming out the station and somebody may be chasing someone else out of matter Penn square and I may get shot by a stray bullet or something. I\\'m nervous too.',\n",

And like her, I'm very sensitive to the increase noise that we're hearing in Boston and specifically those lanes that were recently created for the bicycles, they have decreased the number of lanes that were previously there in a number of major routes. And because of that, people are much more irritated and frustrated and the honk and the phones and so on. And also too because it cuts down on the efficiency of getting from point A to point B in Boston because you're backed up now. So I think the noise level has increased due to the, I don't know who made the decision about where to decrease those lanes, but it's an annoyance and it's an irritant and it's causing a lot of noise pollution. So when, Mish I think you even talked about serenity and peace and whatever, it brought me to that, that we have increased the amount of noise due to people's irritation and frustration with those lanes. So I don't know if I'm doing a disservice to the people who are bicyclists. But I think that whoever made the decision could have done a better job in finding the routes that they needed to to amend with these bicycles. Some of those roads weren't built for that, and some of the residents in those areas have been complaining. One woman told me in order to get around the corner to a store that she frequented in the past, now it takes two times, three times as long to get there because now there's only one lane versus two that were available in the past. So the noise pollution for me is something. I love my trees and grass and peace so I'm speaking with regard to peace.\",\n",

I had some class and they were saying to carry a whistle so that if we feel uncomfortable, at least the noise will startle the person who startling you. Oh yeah, that's a good idea. I never thought to carry your whistle and that's a good idea. I have many years ago when I was given one of those spray things, I guess it's against the law that the post office man carry. So if a dog comes to attack you, you can spray it in their eyes but I think that's illegal. I don't think you're supposed to carry those things, but I will definitely get a whistle. That's a good idea. The flashlight you mean as far as crossing the street because it was dark over there. Because it's dark, just a flashlight period. Wherever you feel you need that extra light you turn it on. And as far as that spray being illegal, I don't care. Your safety comes first. You fight the law second after you protect yourself. That's right. I got that spray. And I always say, the postman had given it to me and he said we carry these as postmen if there's a wild dog or anything coming, we can spray it. It doesn't kill anybody but it I guess blinds you or whatever that you can't see. Disabled. Yeah, disabled. Yeah, I'll carry my spray.

At one time he was hospitalized and it continues. What people don't understand is that grief doesn't have a deadline. The way one person deals with grief is different from the way another. Some people are just thrown off and they never recover. That's difficult to believe but they never do. They never do. And the start of my son's issues and problems was because he lost his father. He was very close to his father. I used to say to my brother that he loved his father more than he loved me. I didn't regret that I didn't have a problem with it but just to give you a sense of the relationship. And so from the time, the way my son responds to his father's passing, I always describe it as though a hole in the world opened up and he fell in because nothing was the same after that. I can give you, oh my gosh, a book of the things that went wrong. So when it comes to grief and mental health and needing help, it is not a week long thing. It cannot be. It has to be ongoing and there has to be experts who recognize the severity, the gravity of the situation. They have to have a safe space which many young people don't.

When they do the grief counseling at the schools after that week, do they not allow the students to continue to see someone or once that week is done, it\\'s done. It\\'s up to your parents to figure it out. It\\'s pretty much up to your parents to figure it out. They just walk away and act like nothing happened. Let\\'s just sweep it under the rug. Nothing happened. To this day, we\\'re about what? Eight, nine months in and no one\\'s ever called me to address the needs of my 16 year old son. I am smart enough to have my own services from outside but you would think that this would be a priority to them because I have students from that school who still come here every day and tell me, on the first day of school, this kid came into my home and said to me, \"I don\\'t want to go to school.\" And I was confused. And I said, \"Well, why don\\'t you want to go to school?\" And he said, \"Because I don\\'t want to.\" And I said, \"But why?\" I said, \"You have to finish for our team.\" And he said, \"It\\'s just not the same. I can\\'t go there. I don\\'t want to be there.\" I have another kid who just came up from Alabama and she came over and she said, \"I can\\'t be in the school. No one will help me.\" I have his girlfriend who cries every day. They\\'re not helping us. And it\\'s like they just want to, okay, the person passed and they just want to erase all the memories like this person was never ever there. Let\\'s just not talk about him. Let\\'s not recognize him. He was never there. And that\\'s wrong. That\\'s foul. The people left behind are always there and so much pain which is why we need experts. People who are trained to deal with grief. It is very, very difficult to understand what it, adults don\\'t understand it. You\\'re unable to explain it to young people. If you don\\'t understand it, you can\\'t explain it to them and so they struggle as you are struggling. And so everybody is walking around blind and struggling and nobody\\'s getting help and it\\'s a very difficult, complicated situation and it\\'s ongoing. It goes on for months and years which is what folks fail to realize. I\\'ve had someone say to my son, oh, you\\'re still... I\\'m paraphrasing. I can\\'t remember the exact words, but it was still painful. You\\'re still grieving your father or something like that, years later. For some people, it never ends. It never ends. They learn to live with it but there\\'s always a problem. There\\'s always a part of their lives that just doesn\\'t seem to fit and it\\'s very difficult and I am so sorry Keemysvoice for your loss. I\\'m so, so sorry for you, your son because the road that you will travel, it resonates with me when you speak. I am just so sorry. I\\'m so sorry.',\n",

But after losing my son, I was exposed to so many younger people and they would share with me what their world is like and I didn't know we lived in two different worlds. Their worlds are way different than our worlds and they do collide because as an adult, you could be walking down the street or simply driving your car and you could get killed and that's scary to think that you could sit on your porch and get killed on your porch like that woman that was up in Upham's Corner, she was an elderly person, I think in her 80s or something, just minding her business on her porch and she was taken, she was stolen. And so was my son, my son was stolen. And it's aggravating to think that we have to keep losing. We have to keep having these losses. And it seems like nobody is doing anything to help.

They don't get a, hey, we're working on this. Hey, what is your opinion? So, in a little bit of detail from me more in an example to elaborate is, I was appointed by the mayor to serve on the search committee for the superintendent of Boston Public Schools. That was something that a lot of people within our governmental stand were not proud of. They didn't want to talk and they didn't want to see it happen. But I find this so fundamentally important and I think I made a stand and I left a mark that a lot of people now think of it as something that we need, right? So now it's a staple. Now we want to make it a staple that each time we made these certain decisions we have students there, because adults were finally able to see the importance of having a youth voice in these major decision meetings at these hiring places, because at the end of the day we're hiring those people to serve the youth and we're hiring them to buy them either a better education or a better lifestyle, because at the end of the day they are the ones who are getting affected by these decisions.

So, [A Taurus] producers they have told me, \"Hey, you are a great reporter, you are a great journalist, but you have a thick accent. So you made it better off as a producer or as writer.\" So I was so frustrated, I signed up for accent correction lessons and I practice radio scripts in front of the mirror, and finally I was able to record my first radio piece last year when I started collaborating with a radio station in Boston. But, in trying to find a full-time job as a journalist in English media, it has been a real struggle for me. And I know journalism is a very competitive job. But I wonder, how many people who are great professionals who come here expecting to have a better chance because their countries are so bad that they can\\'t live there anymore and they come here and they just can\\'t get a chance because they have an accent.

I think that you called out in your story, Lina, just about how a lot of decisions are made before people are even brought to the table. And I think that\\'s a big challenge and a big problem. And especially when you do have a city where the former mayor proclaimed to build 70,000 new units of housing by 2030. A lot of it supposed to be affordable and yet you still have instances like what Lina just described, right, that still happens where developers can do their thing without really having to reckon with the community? So yeah, I just wanted to lift that up. But that\\'s a problem that I also see that I\\'m interested in understanding more deeply and interested in learning about how we might change that. Yeah. And I think also, Joe, what you said at the very beginning just about... you said, \"Why is it so hard for a community investment to take place in the communities that maybe need it most?\" And that\\'s just a question that I myself still have. How is it possible to do that in a way that ensures that people can stay where they are? Yeah, I just wanted to lift those two things up and say that I relate to them and that I\\'m also interested in figuring out how to solve them.',\n",

       "  'words': 'I was just going to say that I resonate maybe with pretty much everything everybody said. As I was listening to everybody, I always asked the question of whoever\\'s coming into my neighborhood, whether it\\'s my neighborhood or my neighboring neighborhood, \"What are you going to do for us in our neighborhood? How are you going to treat our neighborhood if I decide to let you in to my network of people to talk to them to figure out what they want? What is the end result? How are you going to represent us statistically? How are you going to talk about us in a way that highlights and celebrates all of our diversity?\" Which you were talking about Somala, which is something that I always talk about. And then, the other thing that we, well, I always think about is that the leadership comes in different forms and this is something that Jasmine said, and why is it that people are always looking for leadership to look a certain way? Leadership looks so different with so many different people in our neighborhoods. I often wonder about the youth in our neighborhood, everybody\\'s looking for the shiny, bright youth in our neighborhood. What about the youth that are struggling? They could be shiny and bright too. Invest in them, which is something somebody else said. I\\'m sorry my memory\\'s a little [inaudible]. But, why do we have to pick and choose who we speak to, and why do we need gatekeepers to protect our neighborhood and our neighbors? Why do we need to protect them? So, all this is all about the way City and institutions have treated our neighborhoods and the people that live here. I know that I raised two Afro-Latinas and they struggle so hard in the paths that they\\'ve chosen. One in trauma, following my footsteps, and the other one decided, she\\'s at school, \"Everybody I\\'m just going into the Military.\" So it was a little shock. But she went into the Military where you don\\'t see too many Latinas in the field that she\\'s in. She\\'s in chemicals. So, I struggle and fight with different institutions and different people for them to understand that our neighborhoods are worth fighting for and that we need to fight, not with each other, but to empower each other, which is something that you all have said in different ways. So I\\'m just all over the place because I agree with everything everybody said. And I have an accent but you only hear it when I\\'m angry and you only hear the southern part. You don\\'t really hear the Puerto Rican side until I\\'m really, really upset. So [inaudible].',\n",

But if I'm correct with that theme that I get some support. But I'm thinking, we all have agreed that we will be here and we've decided that we're going to try and make an imprint somehow in a productive way to combat some of the things that will make Boston a better place. One of the things that I want to definitely say because I don't want anyone who's... only me and David has been here, but I don't want anyone who hasn't, as far as being an original Bostonian, don't ever think that racism isn't rampant here. We're just saying that... It made me think about maybe we've learned how to navigate it in a certain way and I'm going to put a little bit more thought into that because it is and it's present. But I also want to just say that in my travels I've seen it present in a lot of other places as well. No one is the champion of it. We're just champions of sports. We have some of the other stuff taken care of too.

I think because Boston is almost like a big town and some people who grew up here get defensive about it and I think that pushes the narrative especially when some players are free to come here and experience racism and people get defensive. But, no doubt what Joe said, racism is everywhere. Even though I'm a transplant, I first came to Boston when I was really young, and one of my first experience of Boston was the whole Charles Stuart case, and I think that's another reason why, in addition to Boston, the Charles Stuart case, it created this whole I guess stereotype of Boston being a racist city.

       "  'words': \"South Bay, right up the street for me pretty much, 15 minute walk. Recently they've been protesting over there because there have been 14 deaths, serious. And it's just being exposed. There's a lot of things around that. 14 deaths and they want to shut down. People, family members are protesting every day because they're saying that their loved ones are not safe. And I could find out, but I don't know at this point how many were women, but I think the majority of them were women. And so, because of that, that really hits home. And who is responsible for this? A governor is running this state of Massachusetts. And there's been nothing said in terms of, we're bringing it to his attention and he has commented on this situation. So that's one of my questions. How do we make our neighborhood safer? That's the other thing that comes to mind with me is, are we doing all that we can with our youth, because it's not just in one area, it's in the whole sector of the city. If you who listen to the reports over the Summer, with young crime at hand, and I've been in this city a long time ago and it has never been this high and it doesn't seem like it's changing. I haven't given up on our city and I don't think that anybody in higher position should give up either. We have got to do better. We have got to do more with our youth. I know we just went through a pandemic which is another whole issue, but as I looked, as I search, I just don't think there are enough programs for our youth. We don't have enough programs. We don't have enough involvement. And we don't have enough involvement in terms of policing. We don't have enough of them being able out in the community, in the schools talking so that people don't feel like policing is just about pulling you over, pulling out a gun, you know what I mean? Being afraid for your life. We're all very uncomfortable in this. It's how are we going to make it better? What do we need to do to make this better?\",\n",

And I guess the experience I had coming to Boston, for example for college, when I came in 2016 to Northeastern, I always heard about the different neighborhoods within the area. But everyone is just like, \"Oh, go to this neighborhood, then go to that neighborhood.\" And I think people don\\'t think like why different neighborhoods are different. And I one of the things we always noticed, is just differences in education, differences in support system within each community. And I think like all these things make me think of how each community, with more help or with more funding, can be helped more. And have, for example, more safety within Boston. And I think a lot of people have concerns about going to different neighborhoods, just because of what they think that neighborhood is, or what each neighborhood could be like.

A little bit of what was mentioned earlier about affordability, but for me personally, being more trying to figure out what the best word would be, but I guess accessibility in essence. And in particular with young families. So you have the Lead laws for housing, and we were ghosted by realtor brokers and homeowners when we were looking for places to live here in Boston. Because we have a toddler, and we'll have another toddler in our home shortly. And they don't want to rent to us because of the Lead law compliance, which is not fair renting practices. So it makes it very difficult to think of a future here in Boston, when you're dealing with a housing situation on a lease by lease basis, and not sure if you'll even be allowed, from the sense of a realtor or a homeowner, to even begin to look for places here in Boston. Which I think would be very important, to have families here in Boston of all types.\",\n",

We have another child who is missing his arms, and other disabilities, coming to our family through adoption. And we spend most of our day at the parks, and most of the parks we go to that are in walking distance, he can't reach most of the stuff because he has to climb ropes, or poles, or things that his body just isn't able to do. And so, yeah, I guess that's my question. I think Boston has a lot of great, unique parks that for typically abled kids is really challenging and cool. But for children with disabilities, Boston can be a really hard place to be. The roads are tough, the buses are tough to access. A lot of the schools are really old, there's a lot of challenges if you do have handicaps in the city.

We legit only had one field trip to a woman's basketball BU game, one, in my four years of being in the high school, that was the only thing. And we will also wouldn't have soap sometimes, in the bathroom. I don't know, what was up with that either. I don't know if that has to do with funding or what was up with that. But it would be small little things like that around the school. And I also feel like that affected some of the teachers that work there too because they're coming into work every day, they see all these things missing, broken school supplies, things like that, that kills your motivation to want to be a good teacher. So that affects the teacher, then that trickles on all the way to the students and so on.\",\n",

The funds that they receive versus the lack of funds that they have here in Boston, there is a huge difference. I don't know his name, the first one, was talking about that gap, where in their education that they received, it shouldn't happen. It shouldn't be that way.

And when we both finished school, we're looking to get a house here and we've been searching and it's very challenging. I mean, we're coming from Indiana, the cost of living is not as bad home as it is here. But to even think that two thirds of everyone that lives in the Boston area, rent their house and they don't own it, that let you know that they just cost a lot of money. So it's like, I don't know if that could be fixed, but it will make a lot of people's life easier if it was. Excuse me. Since you share that, one of the things that you resonate with is the whole housing. Do you feel that it is within the whole city of Boston where we're lacking, we don't have enough homes that we can sell to people? I really want to hear from your point of view, what is different from you, living in Indiana and then coming here, is there more houses there that you can buy? Do we have more houses here that you can... Give us a little bit more about that. I'll say, because when we initially moved here, we stayed in a graduate housing at Harvard, because that's where my wife is going to school. And the apartment that we were paying for, just so you can see what I mean, cost the same as our mortgage on a house, our two cars and our insurance back home in Indiana, just for a two bedroom apartment.\",\n",

Every month, it looks like they're just building something new. And the traffic here has gone up by a lot. A couple years ago, it might have been a little bit bad, but now it's pretty bad. Especially in the mornings, when a lot of people that bought all these new apartments here, they usually go work in the city. So the tunnels, it's crazy, man. It's jam packed in the morning. So I think they should figure out a way, I don't know, maybe make a new road or something to help the traffic in that area. So yeah, I feel that's a pretty big problem right now, at least in East Boston. I don't know about other parts of Boston. So you feel that if there's less construction, it would equal less traffic or how does that impact you? Are you a driver? Are you a commuter? How is traffic impacting you in your own personal day? I would say in the train, a lot of the times I've noticed that now there's way more delays on the blue line. That's also the same line that's connected to the airport. So it might have to do with that too. Because you always got people coming in and out, that are leaving the airport or going to the airport. But I've also noticed that the trains are now way more packed than what they used to be. And I feel like that's due to all the people that are moving in here.\",\n",

And I feel like that probably has a lot to do with the fact that there's so many new buildings being built in Boston, East Boston, South Boston. When you have all these people moving in and you're pumping so much money into one space, the rent is bound to go up. And then that leads to usually, people of color and minorities getting pushed out due to all these people moving in because now they're not able to pay on rent anymore. They're used to paying X amount or something low and now the rent is increased and they can't afford it. They can't live like that. I know a lot of my friends that do rent in East Boston, they say that it's really, really high. And usually they have to have roommates. It's not like they could just live by themselves. They need maybe two or three roommates. So I feel like it shouldn't be like that. So we could just find a way to fix that. And make sure that on people in our communities, people of color, minorities are not getting kicked out or we can at least give them some type of assistance to be able to pay the rent.

I would want you to give us a specific story that you have experienced within the educational space that drove you to ask the question that you did and share the experience that you shared?

I worked at a school in Cambridge, it\\'s charter community school. So it\\'s over 80% people of color.

I am definitely a people person and I enjoy being around people all the time.

And bullets went around my head, into the van. There were bullets all in the van, everywhere. For some reason, god wasn't ready for me, cause I didn't even get touched.

It took me awhile for them to come in. Offers that they had, and then I had to look for other places, where to get them. And there was still a lot of violence going on. Sometimes they had funding, sometimes they don't, certain things happen and they would close. And what were you going to do with your kids? Trying to get them now, I see all these kids, all riding, jumping, doing all these things. Maybe if they had something, any activity or safety place for them, you won't see like you said, the guns or any kind of violence out there. And some parents cannot really afford... something affordable for parents because some parents work but they can't afford an afterschool program. From a program, I wasn't able to afford it even tho I was working. To afford for a family of two or three, you would need a vulture, they would give you a vulture but it wasn't enough and it was less hours. So I had to look for places, for people, my family members, to stay with them if they were closed or something like that. That's what I say.\",\n",

There's not a gunshot anywhere in the city of Boston that I know about. We got guns that kids have every day, and I'm not talking about little twenty-two's, we're talking about guns that kill people. And I don't understand how you could run for office, make a video and all of them did it, Janey, the other one too, I can't think of her name right now... Michelle? No, the other lady... Campbell. Campbell, now you can make a video on TV that you're running for office with kids every day about... Nothing in your video says nothing about all these kids that have died this year or in the last 10 years. The only thing you're going to get up there and talk about... housing is important, but a kid's life is way more important than ours. And they talk about how they're going to do all these other things and not once in any video did I see anything about violence and getting guns off the streets that would save these kids lives. Cause these kids, they're not making the guns, these guns ain't in Newton, these guns ain't in Brookline. So why so many guns in Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan. That's what I would say to them, what are you going to do to fix that? Put these guns off the street so people like me, like her, like her, like her, like her, and like her, we can walk down the street after eight o'clock at night. Once it gets dark, we all go in the house, we don't even come outside. I'm a man, and I'm not afraid but still, I have to watch every place I go. The only time I feel safe is when I'm in my backyard and I don't live in the province, I live on the street, but in my backyard, nobody sees me, they don't know what I'm doing back there. That's the only place I really feel safe, other than in the house. So its just sad that we have to go through that as... poor people, that's what I'll say, as poor people. That we don't get the consideration that everyone else gets, that shooting is natural. It's nothing.\",\n",

Not too long ago, I think it was last year was it Carmen that they killed the guy, what was it Puerto? Puerto, yes. How many other people did they kill right there? They\\'re just dead. They just came in, just shot at him. I\\'m not gonna say that he was innocent because I don\\'t know what he was dealing with.

People who run neighborhoods, people like myself and Carmen from here and someone else from Brahmin and someone else from there and there, and ask them at a round table with the Mayor, the Governor and whoever else, what's going on and how to fix it? Because when I first started working here, this place used to be packed with kids. Now people don't even let their kids come out, unless we're going to go get them, walk them back home or whatever. And I don't blame them. When I lived in Bromley, we'd go out. When we grew up in Bromley, we had our own police, it was called Bromley Patrol and there was never shooting. Never, no one was doing violence. And we had a Team Center in every house [inaudible] around the city. Everybody did stuff together. We would bring all the developments together, that way there was never any conflict, but now they got everybody spaced out, no one likes each other, they fired all the workers. The only place that has a Senate that's open is Franklin Field and Bromley Heath and... Franklin Field and Bromley Heath that has an active running Task Force and Community Center and doing things for the people and the community. And we need that everywhere. We need the Mayor to come out here, talk to the residents and so the residents can tell them... because I don't think kids are really bad, they grow onto us. Because we got some kids in here, and they were good kids, but they started smoking dope, and now they come running across the field, they getting shot at. Those are the kids that were in here with us, and they were little kids. And now they grow up to be 14 and 15, they're only 14 and 15, they're still little kids. They have to cross the field and somebody is shooting at them. And this happened this summer. So I mean, it's a non-ending thing, it just keeps going and going and going and everything that we try to do is for nothing because the police used to come in here, every day. Shoot pools with the kids, they just got a new captain, he just got fired. They got a new captain, he took the police out of here. We had three officers who used to come here every day, shoot pools with the kids. Now, if you notice three police officers in here, everybody is going to send their kids in here because they know its safe. And they don't even have to stay in here. They would take their car from here, go out and come back. They were always here, that type of thing. Its things like that, is what the Mayor and the Governor need to know, that needs to be in community so that we could feel safe. Or just to have a car parked there. And take his car from there, they're riding around the city doing nothing. I'm serious. I see cop cars all over the place, they're not doing anything to me, they're on their cellphones, they're out there on detail making triple money. Why do they need the detail? If we are not safe, why should they be safe to be parking on the street. I'm talking about the people that are working tho.[crosstalk 00:46:29] in our neighborhood but they're not guarding us. That's just ridiculous. How could you be someone of power and you have a brain and you think, and you can't see\",\n",

I\\'m mixed, I\\'m clearly mixed. Well I can\\'t say that really. But I\\'m African and Southern European and just like, I heard stuff like people referring to me as like a member of Al Qaeda at the age of eight years old. Then like I remember I was walking to Boston Bowl and everybody knows Boston Bowl in Boston. I live near Boston Bowl. I still live in the same place and literally, I\\'m walking there to go play games at the arcade and I am now 11 at this point. A car full of young men, who are probably from a different part of Dorchester, they pulled up and they said, he said, \"Oh you know, where are the bombs? Can I get the bomb off of you now?\" Then they just all laughed. I heard the clinking of beers and they just drove off really fast and just like, that made me think of that. So I connected briefly in that moment to that. Then just like overall, about the schooling and what you were saying earlier, Bianca, about just the really big differences in the schooling and I think a lot about how like other of my peers, who also did get held back, didn\\'t stay. They were just like, \"All right, if I\\'m going to get held back, then I might as well stay home, or I\\'ll just go to another school where they don\\'t even take attendance.\" Those are all really real things and some of those people who I\\'m just now mentioning, I see them, it was in the last five or six years and they were in prison, or they are imprisoned, incarcerated, or they are dead. I remember seeing the news and seeing my friend Rudy, who I knew was in foster care and stuff, he was in a shoot out with the police in like 2016 and he passed away as a result. I knew that his attendance was really bad, back in elementary school. So schooling has a huge impact on how a youth\\'s life can turn out as an adult. Racism also, has a huge impact on how a youth can turn out as an adult. So you know, these are institutions of inequality. They were made this way for an original purpose that we could argue back and forth on for hours, but it\\'s a matter of fact that our youth are getting harmed, in school and outside of school, on the way to playing games and stuff like that and not everybody can just tough it out and just whatever, pull them up by these imaginary bootstraps that we keep hearing about. Not everybody has a bootstrap to pull up, so. I\\'d love to see the conversations and approaches change to these systems.',\n",

So now I\\'m like, [inaudible]. But you know what I mean? Yeah, connotation and context is super important, like as far as the communities go. But I definitely resonate with the stories that you both shared. Obviously, as someone who lived in Roxbury and Grove Hall, my entire life and now I\\'m living in the North End, because it\\'s more affordable than where I used to live, is like that\\'s a direct result of the ways that my community is currently and has been gentrified. I think that it\\'s important also to recognize that for many different people, their circumstances are different. You know what I mean? We have different lived experiences and different like economic, we have different I guess ideas of economic stability and lived experiences with that, as well. So my story is like very different from a lot of other people\\'s, but being someone who is the youngest and I never take youngest sibling, you know what I mean, like slander, because I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know. But yeah, you know what I mean? Like being the youngest of a household of four children, two of whom were like adopted. It\\'s like, kind of the idea of community that I share, or that I have and that I hold dear, is like very different than a lot of other people. I definitely think that seeing the gentrification that\\'s taking place right now, it\\'s very reminiscent of how the community kind of felt very disparate when I was younger, do you know what I mean? Because, you have people that you\\'re close to, you have your kind of blood relatives and your blood family members and stuff like that. But then you also have these like adopted family members who are like, you want to care about and who are like they\\'re a part of your family and you go to love them and stuff like that. You know what I mean? That\\'s your brothers, your sisters. You feel me? But at the end of the day it\\'s like, there\\'s still always going to be a divide. You know what I mean? I feel like the people that are moving into the neighborhoods, they\\'re not to blame for the gentrification that\\'s taking place. It\\'s more so around the foundations that are being laid by the city to be able to have those people move in. You know what I mean? I think that divide is something that happens a lot. I saw that happen like my own household, just like with adopted siblings and myself. You know what I mean, with my birth mom and sister, it\\'s just like, it\\'s easy for us to fight each other and kind of not like each other, because it\\'s like, \"Oh you\\'re this and this and you know whatever.\" But it\\'s not really conducive to an environment that we can all grow and thrive in. You feel me? Like there can be like space for people to be able to live in affordable housing and I mean there can be [inaudible] folks who are, you know what I mean? Like whether they\\'re a part of the artist community or they\\'re a part of the business community, whatever, to be able to find space. Because there shouldn\\'t be that, like one group of people shouldn\\'t be pushed out for another group of people to be able to thrive. You feel me? I feel like until the city has that in mind, so that concept gets through their skulls, we\\'re not going to be able to have a clear understanding of who, of what community actually feels like. You feel me? I think that\\'s difficult, just because obviously we have, you know what I mean? It\\'s kind of just the way that oppression works, you know what I mean, in general.',\n",

So I think that I experiencing it for so long and not seeing it being resolved or get any better, I think that it makes us feel hopeless. I\\'m assuming you\\'re Mel King son, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So your father have been carrying on pretty good fight. Remember when he ran for mayor and you would think all the hard work he had put out things would be better. So you wouldn\\'t be having this discussion, but here we are, I mean the same discussion. So my personal opinion is that I think you get to a point where it wears you down and makes you feel hopeless. I think what we probably need is some hope, a breath of fresh air. One of the things someone comment on, is the voting and everyone concentrate on the presidential vote. I think, I\\'m not speaking for him, but I think in my mind, when Obama was running, we were hopeful. \"Wow, things are getting better.\" And I think that\\'s what we need in our community right here in Boston. We don\\'t see things are getting better. We\\'re not feeling it. So, we\\'re kind of in the dumps a little bit. So I think we need a rare hope.',\n",

We need to see good things happening. We need to probably see our next door neighbor doing good, so we know, \"Oh, okay. Hi, wow.\" One thing about me is that if I\\'m accomplishing things and getting better, I want... in my business, if I\\'m making money, everyone else is making money with me, all my employees got to grow with me. So I don\\'t have a problem bringing people along because I know where we\\'re there\\'s so much more we can actually do. And I know for fact, you can\\'t run a business by yourself, so you have to bring people along. You\\'re making money, they should make money. The more money your company make, the more money your employee should. It\\'s better for everyone. You just can\\'t be on top of the hill by yourself. You need other people with you. You need people to share it with. So I think we need, like I said, back to my original, I think we just need a rare of hope.

And that\\'s why you got folks coming from other parts of the city into Boston, because the other parts of the city are not feeding them drugs, are not giving them that methadone, are not letting them just do what they want to do. Here we have other cities like [inaudible] and [inaudible] that said, \"Listen, no, y\\'all, can\\'t come over here with that. We\\'re not helping.\" But some of those are their people. It\\'s a shame that folks are like that, but they\\'re like by choice. And we as residents of the city of Boston have to endure what\\'s going on down here. We have to be careful when we walk down there to make sure that we don\\'t step on needles. We have to make sure when we take our kids to the parks, they don\\'t pick up a needle. And that\\'s why I said, if black folks come together, together, we can get things done, because there is a way to clean up, we have to stop feeding them drugs. You know what? If one of us get caught selling drugs, we\\'re going to jail. So why does the government give a pass? We have to figure, \"Okay, what\\'s going on?\" Because I tell people, any politician who\\'s running for office tells you that they\\'re going to clean up Methadone Mile, is lying to you.

But even having section eight made it difficult for her to be able to even work because while she was still working, she was raising three kids on her own.

They tell her, \"Oh, go on food stamps.\" Food stamps says she makes too much money. And now, as an adult myself, I can see real fast why she would have those problems. I do make above minimum wage, but even still, that isn\\'t even enough to be in a ...

So overall, just the overall health care and understanding how it works, what's its cover, and the availability for everybody, I guess. So how did it affect you? Well, like I said, it was discouraging, dropping out of maybe a counseling program when I was probably wanting to talk somebody or dealing with something personal. So it's almost like you're starting over or you got to deal with all those issues yourself. So maybe something expired, or I'd miss a counseling session because of it.

Sometimes you have to draw people in with, not saying it has to be something attached to it, but it's almost like there's a time and a place to deal with in order to get people to really get involved. Again, I kind of use that whole thing that happened down in Dudley Station and Nubian Square. You saw people really, really fighting to change this name.

And where someone is just starting off their life at 18, it seems so sad that you would get to this point, but it was out of your control. So it's like, how do you help him? And even as myself as a mental health advocate and counselor, it was hard for me to work from within the home because I'm always working with clients outside of the home. So when it hit home that my son was depressed and like, he just didn't want to get up for school. Like he would roll to the bed and wake up, turn the laptop on and be in class in the bed and just not present at all. So it was so sad to watch that for, like, he struggled to get out of school. And the way the school system was set up, it was like they did everything to ease the kids so they could just get out. But to me, I still think that they weren't ready. The pandemic did push them back, but because of what was needed, like through policy or government, that they had to get these kids out of these seats for the next batch to come in. And also with making them come back in this year, I don't know, to me it was like a force as well, because a lot of people are still getting sick. But just having that reflection of young people just going into a shell, it really resonated with me that that also occurred. And that was on the day of the shutdown where my son actually, he just went missing. He just kept walking around and hanging with friends. We had no idea where he was. And that was the scariest time that I ever experienced something like that with one of my own children. I'd never saw that happening with him because he knows how we are and how we'll wrap our arms around him. So it was just so, like... I guess I was out of this world. Yeah. Because it was like, we couldn't find him, the pandemic happened, they sent the kids home, we don't know what's going on. And it just was, yeah, bananas, pure chaos. But where I'm trying to work him back into society, so he's gotten a little job and he's moving through.

And then also for me, also the social interaction, which I feel like I lost out on before the pandemic, because I had a baby and just stuff was changing. And not having access to specific resources to help myself move forward because people just go to work and go to work and just go to work. But when you\\'re unhappy and you go to work, you don\\'t want to go to work because I don\\'t want to do that. That\\'s not something that I want to do, so I don\\'t want to go there. So then that was a depression, I fell into a very deep, dark depression because of that, because I knew that that\\'s not what I want to do. You know? Like this is, \"I don\\'t want to do this. I don\\'t want to go there. I don\\'t want to talk to these people. I don\\'t want to look at them. I don\\'t want to see them,\" and I became very closed off. And then I\\'m trying to insert myself back into the regular world, and I see that it\\'s not normal, it\\'s not regular. People are just not the same. And it, to me, I don\\'t think it ever will be. And I feel like the resources are very minimum, and... yeah.',\n",

And for me just being a recent graduate for mental health counseling, I see myself in the community working with different organizations or agencies, trying to rid the stigma of having a mental health disorder or issues. I see that is a concern from the pandemic as well, where people were quarantined and people are usually on the go and commuting and the hustle and bustle and the connection with people in your office or wherever you went from day to day. So I see the present health concern of mental health and the stability of its Boston residents, that it should be brought to the forefront of the table, because if we can't start from within ourselves, how can we build community? How can we keep the neighborhoods together? How can we unify? It's like they really have to take notice that this is something that has to be put on the agenda or the program, or however the candidates are leading to press Boston residents.

And for that, for myself, I\\'ve never been diagnosed with it, but I know firsthand just by looking all around that our people need help. Even starting from within my own household, even starting from within the family, like I\\'ve noticed so much from doing all the readings and the research and all that. It\\'s like, it\\'s really there, but why was that always frowned upon that this is the buildup that\\'s going to burst as to why nothing got done about it, or people didn\\'t know how to speak to their physicians or just bring it out. It was like, what happens in the house stays in the house. Mm. And that\\'s not always a good way to rear children or young youth, because it\\'s like, \"All right, so what do I tell? What do I not? But I still need this help.\" So it\\'s, I don\\'t know, it\\'s always been so confusing, but when it happened for my child, I made sure to do everything that I could. And even though I wasn\\'t an advocate for mental health at that time, I knew that it was something that was real. Even though I don\\'t like the way that it was brought up from the school system, because sometimes people don\\'t have of empathy for ways that they deliver messages. So it was kind of, you get on the defense first, before you really accept what was being said about your child or what they noticed. Right. So that needs to be taken account of, like a revamp for those resources in the school to get them some kind of training as well when they deliver those kind of messages to parents about their observance of their student or that person\\'s child. But yeah, so mental health is still really a big forefront because if you don\\'t have sense of self, everything around you is going to always be in pieces. Hm. Okay. So you start in there to get those pieces together so that you can have the coping skills, you can have mechanisms that you can reach for and resources for people that you can reach out to. So, that\\'s my main concern. And to piggyback off with Ms. Carol, the crime is really getting ridiculous. I sat here the other night, and I did hear that those 25 shots that that person got dumped in the other day up on Walk Hill. And I could sit... I was sitting on the couch and I heard each shot and I said, \"Oh my goodness.\" I didn\\'t know where it came from, but to find out that it came from Walk Hill, that\\'s still a distance from me.

So I feel like, because I was trying to be hard on, \"You got to get up and you got to do school,\" it was kind of breaking her down. Not able to see her friends, she\\'s not able to do things that she normally does. I am also unable to do the things that I\\'m used to doing besides like going to the grocery store or visiting my sister or family and friends. I feel like I lost a lot of friendships just because I felt like I didn\\'t... I wasn\\'t aware of myself.

And I didn\\'t know how to manage, like, how do I... how am I supposed to do this? What am I supposed to do? I don\\'t know what I\\'m supposed to do. So even now when people ask me something, I\\'m like, \"Well, I don\\'t really know what to do, because I don\\'t know how to start. So I just feel like it... I mean, I can resonate on it because I mean, I feel like we all are mentally and physically going through the same things, because when you\\'re depressed and that wears on your body, you don\\'t feel good about yourself, you don\\'t want to get up, you don\\'t want to be active.

I\\'ve been homeless twice, due to domestic violence. Actually right when the Long Island shelter was closed, right before the hundred inches of snow that we got that winter and I\\'m grateful and privileged and blessed to have gotten housing after a few months of that. But I observed like when I go over to doctor\\'s appointments over at BMC or being around methadone bile or mass and cast, as some people call it and the situation has gotten more out in the open and it makes me sad and just disappointed to see people not housed. I know that there\\'s some small group that like to be outside because it\\'s hard to be in a shelter, but I don\\'t feel like the city is really doing enough. And I realized that it takes time to build housing, but I wish the city would make an even more stronger stance. And I don\\'t mean just treatment, but having things like there\\'s something called the housing first model where you don\\'t put a ton of rules in front of someone and say, \"You have to be six months sober or you have to stay in the shelter for three months before we\\'ll fill out your verification of homelessness form.\" All these things that just make it that much harder. It\\'s harder to be sober when you\\'re out on the streets. And so, I feel if we had a more listed... I mean, I can\\'t have all the solutions, it\\'s complicated and we could spend literally a whole day talking about just this topic. So for me, I\\'d like to see the homeless get more shelter and get housing and also to people who\\'ve lived here for decades and have been here, I don\\'t like seeing people pushed out to the suburbs, to other states. So we should have housing for medium income levels too and low income and the elderly and disabled and all of that.',\n",

       "  'words': \"will this be a city in which people can be free to be rather than struggle to be? And, for me that touches on a lot of things. The thing at the forefront of my mind is housing and to people being able to be home and feel home and have security in their homes and have their neighborhoods be familiar. And a lot that comes from my history doing a little bit of organizing in Boston, just on a volunteer basis, over the last five or so years. And then more recently, my work is very focused on, housing and neighborhood planning work and know people's control of their own space. Yeah. I think struggle is... You can't eliminate struggle in the human experience and suffering, but struggle based on, to borrow from Bruce, because of how or where we were born into. Struggles as a result of all the things that divide us. What does a place look like where everybody can be? And by be, I don't mean like coexist without tension. I mean, where we can express ourselves fully and not be worried about getting food on the table and at whatever, whether you're fortunate enough to be, gainfully employed, have a career or wherever you are on the various spectrums of life, to feel whole and to have a rich spiritual and community life. So I don't know where those places are. I think those places exist in every place. I don't know if there's a city where people feel free to be. I think Boston, I think we have a long way to go to be... Yeah, I wouldn't go to Boston first if I had to make a list of those cities, even though one probably doesn't exist.\",\n",

I'm 23 years old, but I lived in the city for so long and I've also been born and raised here within and New York. So I was raised here and I was also raised in the Bronx, but one thing I've understood is, not all minorities are accepted in every neighborhood. We used to go into Lower Allston or even Little Italy or even North End, and those kind of areas, you don't really see any of these operators or even businesses in that area. So to say, there is a restriction between Boston and Natives and then coming back to Bruce's ideal is why can't we not all live in peace, but for understanding is the reason why we can't leave in peace because we live under different tax brackets. So as me, I'm a Roxbury native. I could go as far as South End and feel included because there's many Latinos living there. But as a Roxbury native, when I was working in Cambridge, I felt excluded. I felt like I wasn't a part of that neighborhood, even though that neighborhood is, it's two cities in one. So it's very difficult to say or to view that. Okay, I'm from Boston, I'm from the bean, I'm a Red Sox fan. I'm the official patriarch. There's things of that nature, where we are all implemented in, but at the same time, we can't just all cross each other's regions. So my thing is when is it that it's going to be acceptable as me as a Roxbury native, that I'm accepted in Downtown Boston? Now it's very hard because I know the city has different on plans where they're putting in new housings, they're putting in new programs that doesn't really abide by Boston residential people. It only abides by people outside of the city or the ones that are coming in because Boston is technically known as the hub. So being the hub, that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world. So being that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world. And a couple years ago, we was known as the number one city in the country. So my thing is, when is it that the people from our city are going to be accepted in our city? Because we're the ones who make Boston real. We're the ones who make it, the way it is, the persona of being a Bostonian, is not these out of state people. That's my difficulty of understanding. Are we really going to be fully accepted or are we not? And that's the end of mine.\",\n",

And I know that housing as an issue began somewhere in the 70s, with veterans returning and two things, war is hell. So many veterans come return home, male and female, with a lot of issues that there should be institutions there to help people resolve their issues of what's now known as PTSD. That wasn't even a channel to turn to, if you will. Over all of our wars as this country, there been no notifications and the name has changed to protect the innocent. But at same time, you did not see the numbers of homelessness that you do now. And again, it's started in a very different time. You also had a situation under I believe, maybe Ronald Reagan, if any youngins can remember that, where the deinstitutionalization of folks who had issues not necessarily war related, but had mental health issues, spiritual issues that were in an essence turned out into the streets. Because the theme at the time is, well, we can find a place for them to come and get their medication. And they can self medicate, and blah, blah, blah, which was absolute down to Coca Cola. Now you move to a time now, where the bottom is beginning to become thicker, because of our social economic situation, Nancy spoke to and please don't misunderstand. But her position as a white person in Boston, even with that, there were prevailing kinds of situations economically, socially, that have now thickened again, the bottom of people who otherwise would not have the same worries or concerns. And how do we take that super huge problem and crystallize it and stop the life out of it, if you will, to bring it to the larger body because the body of people who are falling under that social economic state is growing. And it's including everybody, people who maybe once thought that they were safe. When you think about homelessness and you think about people in this town, in this city, who are second generation homeless. I'm not talking about just falling off to a corner somewhere. But a homeless person, homeless family, has now raised children who are now homeless children and growing into adulthood and they don't have any perspective of shelter.\",\n",

Is it just going to be the people who have lived here longest are just totally gone.

There are neighborhoods that I won't go into that I am afraid to go into, like Mattapan, like Roxbury, even Dorchester. I don't feel safe in those neighborhoods. I'm a trauma survivor, and I don't even feel safe in my own neighborhood, on my own Street. I was chased down my own street. So that's how I resonated to what Turita said. And it also seems like Boston has lost a lot of its fun. We used to have in the '70s and '80s and '90s, we had dance clubs and people would go to the dance clubs and dance and it was fun. And the music was great. And we don't have those dance clubs anymore, a lot of them have closed. We're lucky if we have one dance club in Boston. I don't know of any at this point.\",\n",
