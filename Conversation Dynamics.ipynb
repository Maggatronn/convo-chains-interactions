My question to myself and to the rest of Boston, how can we help? How can we help change that narrative where there's no Black developers of substance that will step up to that challenge? How can I step up to that challenge as a Black developer?

       "   'words': 'I\\'ve got a lot of stuff going on in my head. I\\'ll say one of the things that kept repeating in my mind as everyone was talking is, out of Dorchester CARES, I started a mom support group called Mothers Raising Black and Brown Boys, and it came about when George Floyd was murdered. I had some moms come to me and they said, \"I feel like I need to do something because I have a Black son. What can we do?\" This was something that had been sitting with me, and I just didn\\'t know when to put it together. The timing wasn\\'t there, and then when that happened, that\\'s when I knew it was time. We just got some moms together, and we just talk about a lot of different things and support one another, but it\\'s exactly what you\\'re saying, Zakiya, too. I really believe that in the city of Boston, there is just a set of people in our communities who are not on Facebook, they don\\'t watch the news, they\\'re not reading the paper, they\\'re not on Twitter, so they don\\'t know how to get help.

And my experience is, in high school, I was in a Mass experimental school system and we had this system called the model high. And it was part of, like they had a lower school, middle and upper.

So I get to see how they treat them differently. And I\\'m also a parent in the school system. So I can see firsthand of how home culture can get confused with school culture and the school culture is totally different and teachers are doing the best that they can, but there will never be a connection without that home culture. So that\\'s where they misunderstand and misinterpret our children\\'s signs. Somebody might see my son as aggressive, but it\\'s probably passionate or a cry for, \"I don\\'t understand.\" When you have teaching tools or you\\'re trying to say, \"Okay, well, this kid needs to learn social, emotional growth and tools to voice what the issue is that all school year, you say, \"It\\'s okay, you can be mad. It\\'s okay, you can be mad, but just tell us what you need.\" '},\n",

That you don't hear these voices for one reason or another. But as someone alluded to earlier, everyone's voice matters and their concerns are legitimate. They're your concerns, right?
