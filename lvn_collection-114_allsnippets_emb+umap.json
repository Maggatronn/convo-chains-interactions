My question to myself and to the rest of Boston, how can we help? How can we help change that narrative where there's no Black developers of substance that will step up to that challenge?

I've mentioned this last night and I'm going to bring up the conversations that we've had about it lately. The silos that we operate in Boston, everyone's doing their own thing but not knowing what each other are doing, and that trickles down to even families. Families don't talk to each other. They don't eat dinner with each other. I think the pandemic has caused us to kind of stop and look and see that we do need each other.

Okay? So that's where we're going to start. So, first of all, I want to thank you all for giving up your valuable time and participating in the real talk for Boston conversations. These are a set of conversations we're trying to support people around the city of Boston to have that we believe can actually have an influence, not only on the upcoming elections, but really provide a way for people to make sure that their lived experiences are being considered, not just for the election, but also to build a network of conversations that actually can be used monitor what's going on in society within the city.","d0":2.3207526207,"d1":5.8396596909,"textlen":174},{"conversation_id":1380,"index_in_conversation":1,"speaker_id":32693,"speaker_name":"Ceasar","transcript":"There are a couple of things we're going to ask you to do in this process, but before we do that, I want to talk to you a little bit about why we're recording these conversations. One of this is... And I need to start with the purpose, I guess. The purpose is we're trying to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across communities and within communities. So we're inviting you to this conversation, which we think is going to be a little bit different than what you have normally have experienced. Then the second part is, let me say a little bit about the recordings. Okay. So following this meeting today, actually don't worry about that. I have a scratch because usually we do this on Zoom now and we tell you that we're going to throw in the video and only use the audio. So all we're using today is the audio. Okay? And...

Okay. So anyway, as I said, normally we do this on Zoom and I realize this script has all the Zoom cues in it, as opposed to just we're in person. But so normally what we do in these conversations is what we're going to do is we record these conversations. They go into something, what we call the Living Voices Network. It's an online forum that we are actually able to lift the recordings into, get a transcript of those and then that transcript in and of itself will be visible online. And our technology then goes through and looks for the things that are in the conversation. And you can actually search through the conversations by the things that are in there.","d0":3.8756847382,"d1":6.5460238457,"textlen":135},{"conversation_id":1380,"index_in_conversation":8,"speaker_id":32693,"speaker_name":"Ceasar","transcript":"And so this will allow us to connect. What we're trying to do is honor the importance of small conversation, and then at the same time, be able to connect across small conversations to really make something much bigger. So what we're asking really right now is that as a participant in this conversation, that you are going to provide consent for Real Talk Boston to use and retain this recording in accordance with our mission. And that you understand that the conversation will be part of a collection of Cortico's Living Voices Network whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. So we will collect, retain and analyze those conversations in keeping with that mission. However, the ownership of those conversations, who owns them will actually be a selection of community-based organizations throughout Boston.","d0":3.5938019753,"d1":6.862798214,"textlen":146},{"conversation_id":1380,"index_in_conversation":9,"speaker_id":32693,"speaker_name":"Ceasar","transcript":"We're working on the final agreements, but we know since they will actually do one, the Southern Technology Center we'll do one, there'll be one of the hosts and owners and we have Inductive is going to be another one. And the Family Nurturing Center is going to be another one. So we have a couple of community-based organizations who will actually serve as the owner of the data. So MIT's not going to own it. Cortico is not going to own it. Community-based organizations are going to own it. And if you decide at any time you want to not be on the system anymore or something like that, you can turn to a community-based organization who can help make that happen. So that's the way that we're going to move in with that. So with that understanding, what I need to do is have each of you go around and say, if you are in agreement with this and you're willing to be recorded, and this is the last of the formality.

This is a very structured conversation. So I'm going to give you some prompts. I'm going to ask you to respond to those prompts only and at one point we'll have a much more fluid and open flow. One of the things that's really important about this conversation is, we ask you to speak only for yourself. Everything in this conversation is about grounding in your own experience.

Go around and you say your name, say where part of Austin you're from, and then check in on any one of those items. And then once you finished checking in on that item, what you say is, \"And with that, I'm in.\" Meaning, I'm here and present. And I'm going to model for me. My name is Ceasar McDowell, unfortunately, I'm not from living in Boston. I live in Brockton right now. I'm going to check in emotionally right now.

So the experience I'm thinking of is a small community based nonprofit that I work with that was given a legislative earmark from a state agency. So we went to meet with the person to get it. It's like 50,000 bucks. It was like really good for the small organization.

These issues of skills with teachers and certain restrictions that happen. And so yeah, how do we move sort of beyond that is the question. And my experience is, in high school, I was in a Mass experimental school system and we had this system called the model high. And it was part of, like they had a lower school, middle and upper. And one of the things about it was that a lot of the young people that went, they went because they were either kicked out or had difficulty either learn differently or whatever in the traditional school system.","d0":1.5853960514,"d1":3.4182891846,"textlen":135},{"conversation_id":1380,"index_in_conversation":58,"speaker_id":32695,"speaker_name":"James","transcript":"And so as an experiment, I thought that this is a skewed experiment because what you're doing is that you're loading the experimental school.

So we was filled with kids who had behavioral issues, or had some difficulty in a lot of ways in dealing with the typical system. And so that was one reason why I think that it never got on track because of the results. When I see that happening again, I see the same ideas about trying to open up the classroom and trying to not have grades and trying to design schools that try to meet the students where they are and just going through the same cycle.

So I can see firsthand of how home culture can get confused with school culture and the school culture is totally different and teachers are doing the best that they can, but there will never be a connection without that home culture. So that's where they misunderstand and misinterpret our children's signs. Somebody might see my son as aggressive, but it's probably passionate or a cry for, \"I don't understand.\" When you have teaching tools or you're trying to say, \"Okay, well, this kid needs to learn social, emotional growth and tools to voice what the issue is that all school year, you say, \"It's okay, you can be mad.

So it's to be able to see that and to go through some experiences as a mom of a black child with another teacher and see like whole, it's like, yeah, educational system use my languages like that because of the world spent, the teachers not talking to the parents and the parents are afraid of the teachers and the teachers are afraid of parents, but nobody is willing to tell them that.

And I don't know if it's because people just didn't care or if it wasn't important to them, that it was important to us to get to where we needed to get to on time so that we can keep our jobs or that we don't have to experience detention in school. Because that was my issue back then when I did have an issue with the MBTA is that, if the bus was late and then crowded on top of that, it would just pass us by. And so, I would always get to school late and I don't care what time I got up to try to make it early if all the students trying to get to school early too.

We need solutions, and the solutions are give us trade before we leave high school. Stop forcing everybody into college. Yes, they put it on hold till 2022, but come on, everybody got their hands in the kiddy pool. You can't do that. You have to give them real solutions.

I was thinking about, there's been a lot of improvements going on in our community as far as housing renovations and development. There's been some educational opportunities, more ways to get educated as far as GED programs and small trades and a lot of it's free. There's been a variety of cultures living together now, agriculture's going on where people are doing local farming and stuff. My concern is about the prices going up for the cost of living in Boston. And the reason why I care about this issue is because I lived in Boston independently as a renter for about a year. And living there as a renter, to be as a single person with no children, I found it to be a little bit costly. And I didn't know if that was because of the renovations and the developments that's new, or if maybe it's always been like that, I never noticed.","d0":0.0520116389,"d1":4.4969978333,"textlen":156},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":38,"speaker_id":32966,"speaker_name":"Ziona","transcript":"But the cost of living in Boston has gone up tremendously, especially in the last two years alone.

A lot of my peers are in the bracket where they make too much to be on housing or have a subsidy, but they don't make enough to pay market rent.

There's mold, but it's a thousand dollars for two bedroom next to the train. I have cataracts. I'm not going to be able to drive forever. You know what I mean, I want to have an active life in my retirement and I want to be in the community that I walk down the street and I see people.

And thank you all for sharing and that's my sentiment as well. And if I wasn't fortunate to be living in the house that I grew up in, it would be a challenge to find similar type of housing. And that's why I chose to do some of the things that I'm doing in terms of a builder. So it's really reassuring to hear real voices.

So I think that that's a major issue that we're seeing in big cities like San Francisco and them being ridiculously out priced and people having to move. And it's happening here in Boston and where will our neighbors be? Well, we won't have that sense of community when we can't afford to live here.","d0":1.8023331165,"d1":4.3108086586,"textlen":84},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":48,"speaker_id":32966,"speaker_name":"Ziona","transcript":"I resonate with everyone, but I resonate a lot with Cindy and Reverend Dr. Norm about working in the recovery field and having lived experience with recovery and being homeless and such things. It is hard for people to get out of a program and find affordable housing to stay in that community where all their resources or their clinicians and their support and where we have a lot of recovery places for detox and stuff like that in the Boston area. How can and also the working class I agree with, I resonate with Fran on that, the working class, all of that comes into place because we're all, I notice a common theme in my work is everyone's looking for stable place to rent or own or even sublet even. Sometimes it's hard for landlords to find tenants. So that's a whole nother thing, but I resonate with everyone.","d0":2.9660863876,"d1":4.2179169655,"textlen":151},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":49,"speaker_id":32963,"speaker_name":"Francesca","transcript":"Okay.

How can we fight the stigma in Boston and this pertains to my place in it because I live with mental health, I work in the mental health field, I do a lot of volunteer and activism work there.","d0":2.2243244648,"d1":3.0445768833,"textlen":149},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":69,"speaker_id":32966,"speaker_name":"Ziona","transcript":"And I find it very rewarding and I find it very useful for us to also not just focus on our financial life or focus on our spiritual life as a community, but to also focus on our mental health and trying to break these vicious cycles of what comes with trauma.","d0":3.8885281086,"d1":4.5414776802,"textlen":52},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":70,"speaker_id":32963,"speaker_name":"Francesca","transcript":"Thank you so much.

And 19 of the 30 kids were from Boston public high schools. And it was in 1975, 76, 77. So it was right after school desegregation and the city was going coocoo.

So each of you stated two questions. And so I'm saying that I want you to think about what you heard and what resonated from a specific person, either of those two questions because we did two.

I've buried more young people, not now because now I'm older, but 35 to fifties, there was so many people dying all the time. And I actually did an experiment with a friend of mine. We tried to score a bag of reefer or a gun on a Saturday night in the nineties, he was a Black man, I was a white woman. We couldn't find pot, but we found guns easily. And I was like, if I can find a gun, then why can the Popo find a gun?","d0":2.7810459137,"d1":3.2371490002,"textlen":150},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":82,"speaker_id":32963,"speaker_name":"Francesca","transcript":"So Cindy, I've always really appreciated the work that you've done with Peace Boston and your story about burying more young people than elders really resonated with me because that was my experience as well. And I haven't shared this with too many people, but my daughter, a few years ago, somebody shot at her, somebody around the corner shot at her and then the gun didn't go off and pistol whipped her, messed up her nose, broke her nose and it was pretty traumatic. So that was traUMatic. But what was even worse was making the decision because I lived around the corner in a house with my four girls, young girls who had to go by that house every week, every day, not to do anything about it.","d0":3.1583917141,"d1":3.575558424,"textlen":130},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":83,"speaker_id":32963,"speaker_name":"Francesca","transcript":"And then a couple of my male friends said, \"Let's get [Tarida] in the car.

If we had restorative justice practices where people could name the harm and take action to repair, a lot of people would be alive and a lot of our brothers and sisters would not be in prison. So thank you for reminding me that gun violence is such an epidemic in our society and nobody in my opinion has figured out systemically how to address that. Sorry, I took so long. I don't even know who's next.

What I wanted to say the question that resonated with me is ironically yours, Fran, because I grew up in Mission Hill during the busing era. I moved here after living in Grove Hall and I came to shell shock because over there I had Black neighbors like myself and then I came here and it was primarily white. My first experience was going up to the playground in Mission Hill and having a white kid punched me in the face, no reason at all. And then our first encounter was my sister having to beat him up. And then in the fall, turns out that he's in my class. And so this is the beginning of my life as a middle schooler, listening to the stories of the high school and them having race wars and us fighting with our friends who were friends in school but as soon as we crossed the street from the Catholic middle school that we went to, then it was all hell that broke out.","d0":2.2528371811,"d1":3.5586192608,"textlen":175},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":86,"speaker_id":32965,"speaker_name":"Cindy","transcript":"And so I became an activist when I was 14, very young. And probably at that time subconsciously leading to my adult life as an activist, I never did anything in Mission Hill. I never wanted to have anything to do with this area, but sleeping. And so I think that probably about three or four years ago, I joined the board of our neighborhood bus but before that, I still had a lot of that animosity. So the systemic racism that exists now as the community and cultural engagement manager at Mass General hospital, I'm doing my best to break down a lot of those walls and having to fight with white people to get them to see why this is not a handout or a hand up, but it's just telling them that they as a system need to give back to a community that they've turned their back on for so many years.","d0":2.385256052,"d1":4.6238965988,"textlen":156},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":87,"speaker_id":32963,"speaker_name":"Francesca","transcript":"Thank you, Cindy.

And I could pull from my history something applicable. So I think I might honor all three and say a little bit about all. In terms of Cindy's experience with racism, growing up, I remember walking home from Boston Bowl and this is on the east side of Washington. And it was four of us. We were all Black from the west side of Washington and the only way to get to Boston Bowl was walk. And we got jumped on our way coming back from bowling and car of young white men, young white boys jumped out and started to swing at us with golf clubs. I remember getting hit at my chest and the club breaking off. And ironically, how we got out of that, a vehicle stopped with an interracial couple. And then the neighbors who saw who were all white, came down to help us because they didn't feel what was happening was right which is true.","d0":2.6334319115,"d1":3.6826426983,"textlen":180},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":92,"speaker_id":32964,"speaker_name":"Corey","transcript":"And so that really tainted my view on some of the race issues, because at around the same time we were being bused as well, from Dorchester to, I was bused from Dorchester to West Roxbury- the Joyce Kilmer.

And it's a real thing. And Boston, like this storm coming the T-stop in the South Bay has to be four to five, so that the station wouldn't get a flood with the anticipated storm coming. So it is real. There'll be more storms like this. And I'm working to get the word around about climate change.","d0":0.9308230281,"d1":3.6052117348,"textlen":85},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":94,"speaker_id":32964,"speaker_name":"Corey","transcript":"And then the third aspect is the mental health issues and challenges that we as a community face. They really overlap with a lot of the different things that we are concerned about at this table right now. And if we can see the connection, you can see how important it is to act today. With mental health, we don't really see it as a job issue, but it really is because when lives are stable and incomes are comparable to the national average, lives are better and the stress is less and you don't look for self-medication and you treat your kids better. So the quality of life all the way around where all of these things seem seemingly not connected are very interwoven like a sweater. So we have to really take a mindset of all the challenges that we have. So I think one thing that's coming to me now is that it's not a silo, it's all related and we all can help each other.","d0":3.0577714443,"d1":4.237967968,"textlen":169},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":95,"speaker_id":32963,"speaker_name":"Francesca","transcript":"Thanks so much, Corey.

I resonated like Corey with a little bit of what everyone is saying, but I'm going to talk a little bit about what Cindy's point was about gun violence, more advocacy towards gun violence prevention and protection and just violence in the community in general. Sometimes it's not just about weapons. I'm going to get a little bit intimate here and share something that happened to me recently. Last winter, I was in crisis and I had lost my phone. Well, actually my phone had broke and then I had lost it. It was raining really bad that day. And I went into crisis and I was looking for a phone to use. I was near a friend's house. So I said, let me walk to this friend's house because usually they are at home, maybe I can use their phone and get a ride back to my house or whatever I got to do.","d0":2.8326387405,"d1":3.5920166969,"textlen":156},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":97,"speaker_id":32966,"speaker_name":"Ziona","transcript":"So I was on my way to the friend's house and I saw the friend in that area. So I didn't even make it to their house. And I was asking them, \"Oh hey, my phone got wet in the rain. I don't have a bus pass. I need to call a ride. Can I use your phone?\" And they was like, \"Oh, my phone's off. I'm going to go pay my bill now.\" So I was going to go with them to pay their bill. So I asked, \"Can I just walk with you or whatever?\" And they act like they didn't know me. So that led me to go to wait for them at their house. They said, I could wait for them at their house because they didn't know how long it was going to take.","d0":3.0953903198,"d1":2.9281005859,"textlen":139},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":98,"speaker_id":32966,"speaker_name":"Ziona","transcript":"So I got a little antsy. So I knocked on a neighbor's door and they opened the door and I asked them, I said, \"Hey, I need some help. I just need to use a phone. I'm a friend of your neighbors.\" And I've seen them before and they've seen me before and they just started attacking. So you can imagine how strange that was. It was a very serious altercation. It was more than one person attacking me. Someone called the ambulance because I was obviously beaten up and I had to go to Boston Medical and mind you, I still had no phone. And my family started worrying about me. They had to put a missing persons report because remember I had no phone, I wasn't home. And I was never able to use someone else's phone. And it bothered me that when somebody could be needing help or something and they knock on your door and the first thing you do is attack them, you don't try to give, you know what I mean, help them out and see if there's anything, if they need to use a phone or if you could show them where the ... just help out instead of ... like, the first instinct was for these people to attack me.

I don't know.","d0":3.02632761,"d1":2.5095539093,"textlen":222},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":99,"speaker_id":32966,"speaker_name":"Ziona","transcript":"And so that never made sense to me, but the police did come to the hospital and stuff, but they didn't really do a good job of asking me what was going on. And on top of that, I was really injured. I had to have MRIs and brain scans and stuff like that because I was disoriented at that point because of the blows to the head. And so I feel like a lot of this violence that does happen goes back into mental health. A lot of people have mental health issues and they're not dealing with them.","d0":2.8627495766,"d1":2.5083832741,"textlen":100},{"conversation_id":1412,"index_in_conversation":100,"speaker_id":32966,"speaker_name":"Ziona","transcript":"A lot of people have been traumatized.

And then you see all the violence that happened within the police force and you can see how racism has infiltrated law enforcement.

It won't work like that. That's not learning. That's just having them in classrooms so that these schools can get profit from corporate, more money from corporate America. So that's what really stuck out with me. Just concerned with how to end all this stuff. So it's so many different layers when we've got racism within prison, overcrowded prisons, the Black person gets convicted for whatever reason- say marijuana or something, versus a white person.

And those voices are very important voices and your voice is similar to my neighbor's voice and my voice. So we all are valued citizens of this city. And I want to thank you. And I want those officials to really truly get the point. So thank you for sharing and may God bless you guys. And Shareef, I love the hear to babies and I'm going to give you a big old high five for a brother that's doing the right thing. So all of you, thank you and have a blessed weekend. Thanks.

Emotionally, I'm an individual who just loves this share what's in his heart. But so realistically, what you hear from me will always be something that's true and sincere. Spiritually, that's what [inaudible]. That's it? You don't want to hear about my spirituality?","d0":4.6678080559,"d1":8.4172000885,"textlen":103},{"conversation_id":1413,"index_in_conversation":58,"speaker_id":32974,"speaker_name":"Norma","transcript":"No, I'm sorry.

Let's get to the core of our conversation. As we shed the restrictions of the pandemic, it will be easy for us to lose sight of what we have learned about inequality in America and Boston, how our lived experience have shaped that learning. Keeping this in mind, I like to invite you to think what's your question about the future of Boston, and your place in that future?

Each person will share their question and then tell their story of their experience that led them to this question. I'm posting the order in which you will be invited to respond in the chat, which I believe is already there. I'll help transition us from one person to the next.

So for my question about the future of Boston would be what will... My concern really is, what will it look like with all these new developments and all these different, these new things that are coming up, these new ways of living in Boston. Like these new ways of telling the bus sizes, directions to each library locally, there's bike paths, there's limited parking, there's a lot of construction going on, it's a lot of buildings going up, there's a lot of stuff going down and being remodeled.","d0":-0.088234596,"d1":3.482265234,"textlen":142},{"conversation_id":1413,"index_in_conversation":74,"speaker_id":32972,"speaker_name":"Ziona","transcript":"So my question is really what is that going to look for us when the cost of living is going up for all these developments? And the reason why I say this question is not just for me, but also I have peers, that they make too much money to be on housing, but they don't make enough to afford market rent. Also, for myself when I lived in Boston, I had to move every two years and I had trouble finding single apartment living for myself as an individual, whereas living in a studio was about the same amount of market rent for someone who had a three bedroom. So when I was paying 1200 for a studio, someone could pay 1200 and get a three bedroom. So stuff like that and the cost of living did go up and it was all over the news in the media about the cost of living in Boston going up. So that's my question and my story. And what how it affects me. So next would be Jackie.","d0":0.0507116802,"d1":4.6783752441,"textlen":177},{"conversation_id":1413,"index_in_conversation":75,"speaker_id":32971,"speaker_name":"Jacqueline","transcript":"Oh my God, Ziona you hit it right on the spot. So I was born and raised on Dudley Street. [inaudible] start off with that one. So my question is, what is fair and equal housing and the structure of the infrastructure of our community? So for those low income families. So I grew up right there Corner of Dudley and Blue Hill Avenue. And back then there was rent control. I remember I had a studio... I had a one bedroom apartment for $600. This is back in 1990, 1991 in that state and that was market rent. It was over at 420 Mass Avenue right next to the train station. And right now that same unit is $2200. That's a little bit out of the score. That's almost 80%. Right? So yeah, almost 80% more than... And I did not pay utilities, the person living there, or the people living there right now do pay utilities.","d0":0.4512827694,"d1":4.8312177658,"textlen":158},{"conversation_id":1413,"index_in_conversation":76,"speaker_id":32971,"speaker_name":"Jacqueline","transcript":"So what's fair and what's not fair?

And any advocacy to help them get fortunate because I have been a part of the community and been active in the community all my life.

So my question was, why is that disconnect so strong? And in particular not only in the city of Boston but they seem to be throughout this country but seeing that my life in Boston has been full of the issues that are related to re-entry, homelessness, dysfunctionalism and all these other big challenges that the majority of the people who are homeless are facing, I want to make sure that somehow in Boston, we're able to create a stronger bond, a stronger connection and a deeper commitment to the people who have the greatest challenges that mirror the challenges that we also have had.

And my experience is I have mental health issues and also I've been homeless. So I know a lot of people that was in my shoes with mental health issues and homeless, no one came by and gave us any resources. We had to go up there on our own and figure out how to apply for housing and things like that. So we need more of that in Boston.

Jacqueline, when you were talking about you grew up in this area and you were given the examples of the different prices and you mentioned that you spent most of your life in Boston and now you live in Revere.

You don't need to respond to this, but I wanted if you got priced out of Boston and that's how you ended up in Revere. And just a little... They just said that in terms of the population in Boston, we lost 3% of Black Americans or people that identify black in the census. And they didn't necessarily leave the state.

I worked for a department of mental health in the two biggest shelters. When I see all of this stuff going on with mental health services and lack of connection and so many people dying and suffering out there, so for me that's why I came over here because I feel safer.

And I lived in Boston or the Boston area my whole life and I love the city, but I don't feel like the city loved me back. You know what I mean? When I ended up homeless and was told, okay, you're out of jail but you're on probation. You don't have any resources at all. We're going to drop you off at this shelter and you better figure it out. That was challenging. And I see people dying and not being able to manage that challenge every day. And so I really feel connected to the work on a personal level.

I try to do some research on re-entry in prison and see what's out there and there's places that do stuff but, like George was saying, it's half ended. They have all these good intentions. They give us all these hopeful resources, but access to these resources and the practice of these resources once we have access to there's disconnect. And I think a lot of that plays a part on for me through my personal experience, through social workers and community engages how a lot of them are not hands-on only because everything is so paperwork. Paperwork pushing instead of actually being hands-on, one-on-one with individuals who walk them through these processes to re-entry them back into the community, whether it be from incarceration or mental health or homelessness or any of these things.","d0":2.9173612595,"d1":4.2149906158,"textlen":200},{"conversation_id":1413,"index_in_conversation":106,"speaker_id":32968,"speaker_name":"Francesca","transcript":"Thank you so much Ziona.

You could be number one in line and wind up being number 10 to get the application. So it's an unfair practice going on. And a lot of people are not aware of what's really going on because they're following directions and they're taking advice from social workers and from people like myself. But the people that are actually doing the work are not really doing the work. I'll send a client somewhere or I'll refer a client somewhere and then they're backed into a wall. They run into a brick wall. And it's like what? I don't understand that. So that's why I said what I said.

I know that what I've listened to and heard thus far is a lot of compassion, a lot of passionate commitment and what's really important and it's backed by certifications and experience, real life experience. And that's what I found most people will listen to. And most people will adhere to and acknowledge you and willing to listen to some of the challenges that you've had and then willing to give back.

And hopefully we can then turn around and disseminate that to those that need to hear it and marry those victories in our own lives so that we offer people with (Inaudible) examples that they can use to begin to face some of the biggest steps that they know they have to go forward with. But listening is our biggest thing. And I see that that's something that in our early talks we talked about being generous in our listening. Listening and giving people a chance to really unload and give us a way to really pick out which is the best challenge that we can share with them.

That's one of the things that I felt really strong about the takeaway. One of the things I'd like to leave as a thought that maybe we can all hold onto is that this gift of us giving people an opportunity to really have some ways to take from us is one of the most important and most visible ways today that I have seen that's going to help to assist them. And also give me a great way to just feel good about knowing that the work that I have envisioned and work I've done all my life is something and the stuff we've all done is something we should all be very grateful for and thankful for.

I feel as though that we are reaching out and we are touching a lot of people's lives that didn't know that we had so much patched in [inaudible] and listening skills to hear a person's issue it makes [inaudible] takeaway from this meeting is that there are people that are out there that are very attentive into listening to whatever it is that we're experiencing.

Thank you. I guess my biggest takeaway from this is that, like I said before, this seems to be a common thread that runs through us. And when I can remember coming up where I needed some help and there was no cultural competence, so there were no doctors or therapists that looked like me that I was dealing with. So there was a disconnect. And now all these years later where that's been addressed in some ways there aren't a lot of people doing the work that lived like me. And what I'm hearing from this group is that there are some common themes. And that gives me hope because where it was cultural competence before it's lived experience today that I feel like could really make the difference. So I'm happy to be a part of this as well.

That is very important to me. But I do have, I don't know if it's a concern. How would I know... My question is, how would I know where these conversations take us? Looking at it from a researcher's point of view, rarely do we find out the results of any research project or any type of community project till years later.

Okay. So I can respond to that. And we can do that once we end the recording. I will say that the initial goal is to engage people who are not heard and not necessarily engaged in local elections within the city of Boston. It's really important that if you guys end up being facilitated since most of you no longer live here, that everybody that participates is a resident of Boston. That's really important. And I need to clarify with my supervisors about your roles beyond participants and facilitators. So I just need to clarify that. However, the goal is for like Norma's organization can be an institutional partner and everybody that participates in these will have the link to go and listen to your conversation.

What I heard was as a result of your lived experiences, some people that are in your circumstances currently will hear you better than those that haven't walked in your moccasins.

I make these connections. My daughter says I'm poo poo, but maybe I am. Bipolar and schizophrenia runs in the family. So maybe I need to go see a mental health professional soon.

We bring together old technology, which is sitting around and talking with food. That's old technology. It's ancient. It works. We combine it with some modern technology that allows us to record and hold onto these conversations and actually put them into a format so that they both are preserved but they actually can be analyzed and used for making meaning that can have an impact on policy, and how candidates themselves are thinking about what's on the public's mind.","d0":3.1007833481,"d1":6.0295701027,"textlen":168},{"conversation_id":1414,"index_in_conversation":2,"speaker_id":32975,"speaker_name":"Ceasar","transcript":"So, that's what we're about and I want to thank you for that.

To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. These conversations are focused on sharing personal stories from your own lived experience rather than entering the conversation with your position on the upcoming election of specific candidates. We are doing this to help build connections and foster conversations that improve our understanding of one another.","d0":2.2347521782,"d1":5.9691371918,"textlen":120},{"conversation_id":1434,"index_in_conversation":4,"speaker_id":33204,"speaker_name":"Shareef","transcript":"Secondly, I want to address what will happen to the recording of this conversation for our meeting today.

The conversations, along with all the other conversations that are taking place throughout the city, will be shared with members of Real Talk for Change team members and others who have participated in conversations throughout the Local Voices Network, LVN. LVN is a web-based tool for accessing and exploring conversations designed by the nonprofit organization Cortico. LVN systems creates a transcript for each recorded conversation, and uploads both the transcript and audio recording to the Explorer tool. The system highlights keywords that emerge across the different conversations and allows users to search conversations, listen to audio snippets, and discover patterns.

Some folks, in terms of mental health, some folks get the healthcare attention that they get, but when other folks act out because of mental health, they say they're violent. These ones don't actually get the opportunities to get the care or the evaluation that is required. And because the mental health condition makes them to become violent or commit a crime, they are being sent to jail.

I have a five-year-old and a one-year-old. My daughter, my five-year-old just started kindergarten yesterday. Yesterday was her first day in school.

So, I can relate with those comments that folks have made about education, security in their environment, and especially also, she just talked about mental health. I think mental health is a very serious issue in all our communities, and I don't think it's been given the needed attention. Even if they do, like I mentioned, there's disparities in how the delivery network give attention to mental health illness, and how folks who have mental health illness have been cared for.","d0":2.7707436085,"d1":3.2694904804,"textlen":155},{"conversation_id":1434,"index_in_conversation":130,"speaker_id":33209,"speaker_name":"Elliott","transcript":"I think I would love to see, down the road, how this is taken seriously, and how folks on the streets should be evaluated if, for any reason, they show any signs or factors to classify them to have mental illness, they should get the necessary care.

We'll continue to hope and look forward to a situation where all those are corrected, and we'll continue to give needed attention, support, everything that's needed to make mental health issues, give awareness to people about mental health issues, and give care and concern to it so that we can save those who have mental health, and save our communities too.

They quickly know they have to pay a white business or a white person in that business, but for a black and brown, they wonder is it really cheap or a free service. And it's a challenge and it's very frustrating, because I have probably developed a strong network in my time in Boston and a lot of people want to tap into that network, but they don't want to pay.

It marginalized people of color, it marginalized women, marginalized LGBTQ, all that youth. And I think education is a source of all opportunity and all growth and all wealth.

So why is it that we don't have classes on financing? Why can't we teach cooking class? Why can we teach home economic classes? Why can we not teach our youth how to make a garden?

And it's interesting because I think that that's something education is once we're going to do it, you have to be a public school, or a private school, or a charter school to start your own curriculum.

And I feel we see a lot of buildings and affordable housing units and all these things being pop up, but the demand for is still not being met.

And in a space where there's a lot of just disorganization, and they're not being honest about things. And they're saying, \"Oh, this person's rejecting it, and not creating a full picture.\" We're never going to be able to meet the demand. If the folks that you were doing business with, you're not making it clear to them that this is your expectation. And if you don't meet the expectation, the result is you will no longer have a contract as a property management company.

We want to have conversations with folks that you've had contact with to understand what customer service has been? What process has there been? Has it been transparent? What's happening? And so as we're working to build more spaces and build more housing for folks, I would really love to see this city or the next mayor really have a handle on what is actually happening.

So with affordable housing, what was I was going to say? Affordable housing, what does that mean? It mean something different for everybody. Affordable housing means to me, me now working two jobs to pay my rent, me spending time with my child instead of always at work. And then on Saturday, I'm cramming all this quality time with my child. So that's basically what I did. There was no community and what happened to the affordable community centers, right? So and then, growing up, I grew up with my son. And basically, I had to work two jobs, just to maintain, to make sure that he... I was a single mom, make sure he was able to go into programs and go to community centers and stuff like that. But I got to work in order for him to do that. You know what I mean?

Just because somebody was able to afford a education doesn't mean that they have knowledge and understanding or understand the population that they're dealing with. So I couldn't get those high paying jobs, because didn't had a education, but I had the experience, you know what I mean?

You have to qualify first before you can get this snap. And so stuff like that helps and it benefits your child. But the working class, if we make over a certain amount, we can get that affordable housing, quote, unquote, we can get the support that other families can get.

And thinking about not just getting a house but if you want to have a family, how do you now choose the right location for a school. How do you choose it, where you have good hospitals near you? And I think it's something that goes back to education, not just finances, though we need to understand how does housing happen? How do you make sure someone is held accountable if they're not hiring their friends to get this in the housing? How do you make sure everything connects and fits. And that's why I take it back to education, because if we're not just learning about 400 years of history, or the weather cyber, which is sometimes... It's important, but if we all are at the same understanding of what is going on our society, and I think you've talked about civic engagement.","d0":1.6507754326,"d1":4.6366934776,"textlen":180},{"conversation_id":1464,"index_in_conversation":61,"speaker_id":33402,"speaker_name":"Benedict","transcript":"Voting, we don't talk about that in school at all.

And I think it's also how to not only accountability for people who are in places in power, but how do we take accountability for ourselves, because we are citizens who have so much power. We have the power to vote, but not only that, we have the power to learn and make active change, to create community spaces, sit down and do it. But how do we understand our role? And it's because we're not taught at all. We're not taught that we have one.

For me, Miss Debra, your story resonated with me when it comes to banking and loans and financing. So when I was growing up, when we first came to America from Haiti, my parents, we lived in Everett. And so I went to the Everett school systems. And once you get to high school, there was actually... Everett Cooperative Bank is within the high school. And that was a class that you take. And I took the class for two years. And so you go through the class, they teach you everything about banking, you actually do banking within the schools, kids have accounts and all that, once you graduate, they then position you into the actual branch outside, where you now have a job as you graduate, and you're going through the whole banking system. And so that's something that since in Boston, I've been trying to figure out every corner you turn around, there's a bank, somewhere, but I don't see that being implemented at all.","d0":1.5289891958,"d1":4.4268980026,"textlen":172},{"conversation_id":1464,"index_in_conversation":63,"speaker_id":33403,"speaker_name":"Jisca","transcript":"And a big question for me is that we've been talking about entrepreneurs and businesses and loans, but there hasn't been any discussions on personal. You're building these homes, you're building these spaces, we can't afford them because we can't get loans. So where's the disconnect? Where are the conversations that are being had to know that everything is interconnected? So if you want us to be able to access the generational wealth, typically, in order for us to access it, we need to get a loan in order for us to make that purchase. And we know that through the banking system, it's very predatory practices, it's just absolute. Structural racism within the banking system is just out of this world. And I think that that's one of the ways that we need to make sure that we can start to attack some of the challenges and issues that we're having in our communities, you see more check cashing places than you actually see banks.","d0":1.6321493387,"d1":4.4239301682,"textlen":166},{"conversation_id":1464,"index_in_conversation":64,"speaker_id":33403,"speaker_name":"Jisca","transcript":"And then the banks that are opened, there's no sense of community, you can't go in there, there's no one that really knows your name, no one's actually sitting there to try to figure out what they can screen you for, what products they have that would work for you. It's just taking your money and then not investing into any of the programming around you. And investing in anything that's beneficial for you. But meanwhile, you're giving them your hard earned funds constantly. And that's something that I would really love to see an elected, at least try to acknowledge or convene the banking systems in all the different places that we have, to start to have conversations on how do they better approach people of color, and making sure that the products that they have available work for us, and if our credit scores are not good enough, or we're not meeting the requirements, what programs do you have in place to help us get there?","d0":1.7035000324,"d1":4.4253540039,"textlen":168},{"conversation_id":1464,"index_in_conversation":65,"speaker_id":33403,"speaker_name":"Jisca","transcript":"How can you usher us into a new space where we can walk into your space, and be able to say, \"I'd like a loan, please.\" Actually, we don't even need to be able to ask for a loan, you should be coming to us because you go everywhere else, and you send fliers to X, Y and Z and you say, \"You're pre approved for this amount of money.\" But how do we improve that line of communication and the ability for us to feel we can go to banks and be able to access the funds like we know a lot of other people can.","d0":1.5830366611,"d1":4.4844498634,"textlen":107},{"conversation_id":1464,"index_in_conversation":66,"speaker_id":33400,"speaker_name":"Kenyetta","transcript":"So I connect with everybody as well.

We have these things implemented, but we don't get the knowledge to how to handle it. How do we walk in it? How do we deal with it? How are we able to...

We have Boston High who who did something like what you did. There's no more Boston High. Madison is the only school that I know, vocational school right now.

Because when desegregation occurred, it wasn't for us, it was to access our money. Because they knew that within a Black community, we are one of the biggest spenders.

I felt like they were the last two stopgaps, to really kind of say, \"Everybody's not being included, especially Black folks.\" So when I see everything moving up, and you're seeing the new buildings and new development in the city, I see the conspiracy unfold where home ownership looks like the MCAT scores for schools, where certain folks, usually Chinese folks and White folks score way above Latinos and Blacks, and other folks.

Well, when I graduated high school, \"What did you learn on your walks every day to school\". Now as a man, I realize that we were operating those plantations.

All right, so welcome to one of the Real Talks For Change conversations. Thank you for responding to our invitation and joining this network of voices and conversations that are happening across the city of Boston. We invited you to this gathering by asking you to think of one most pressing question you have about the future of the city of Boston. Our goal today is to share and elaborate on those questions and engage in a conversation with each other. So again, thank you for agreeing to add your experience to the growing chorus of Bostonians who want to speak and be listened to, knowing that it will matter.","d0":1.6742050648,"d1":5.2385501862,"textlen":112},{"conversation_id":1483,"index_in_conversation":1,"speaker_id":33568,"speaker_name":"George","transcript":"I will now begin recording our conversation.

I will now begin recording our conversation and I need to share four important items of information with you before we do introductions. First is the purpose of this conversation. We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across divides, neighborhood, political, and cultural, et cetera. And provide improved visibility and accountability between the candidates and the future mayor and neighborhoods throughout the city. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. These conversations are focused on sharing personal stories from your lived experience, rather than entering the conversation with your positions on the upcoming election or specific candidates. We are doing this to help build connection and foster conversations that improve our understanding of one another.","d0":2.4503755569,"d1":6.019159317,"textlen":163},{"conversation_id":1483,"index_in_conversation":2,"speaker_id":33568,"speaker_name":"George","transcript":"Okay, thank you. Secondly, I want to address that what will happen to the recording of this conversation.

This conversation, along with all the other conversations that are taking place throughout the city will be shared with members of the Real Talk For Change team and others who have participated in conversations through the Local Voices Network. LVN, or the Local Voices Network, is a web-based tool for accessing and exploring conversations designed by the nonprofit organization Cortico.

The next one would be to allow others to speak for themselves. Then it's share the time and allow others to finish speaking and to take turns. The next is to stay curious and ask honest questions. Pause, take time for reflection, listen generously, and assume good intentions, while recognizing that your words have an impact. When possible close unnecessary programs, applications, and notifications, and put your phone on silent. Next one, if you need to listen generously... No, I'm sorry.

My question about the future of Boston and my place in this future is... I mean, my question is centered around the results of the primary of the election. I voted in the election. I was happy to vote in the primary. I even took some first time voters to the polls. I was excited to see, what, two Black... three Black people in the race, people of color, and to see the results where none of them actually made it beyond the primaries. My question is like, well, will Boston ever have a Black mayor? Are they even ready for a Black mayor? I say that with the full understanding of they had their... Massachusetts had the first Black senator ever elected, the second Black governor ever elected.","d0":0.7588192821,"d1":4.106777668,"textlen":132},{"conversation_id":1483,"index_in_conversation":43,"speaker_id":33569,"speaker_name":"Armand","transcript":"And during this time where the plight of people of color are elevated and they had three strong candidates on the ballot, none of them made it through. To me, that felt like... that was a blow. I was like, that was crazy to me. I couldn't even fathom that, especially when I looked at around, at one point in time, I think last year, maybe even this year, Boston had a Black district attorney, Black sheriff, Black chief... I mean commissioner, excuse me. But basically had Blacks in every level of law enforcement at the highest level. I don't know. And I'm thinking like, will Boston ever have a Black mayor? That's why I checked in like intellectual. Because to me, that's something... I think this was the best chance ever to have a Black man and it never happened. I know that I've been in Massachusetts a long time and I've known somebody become the mayor, they're there till they die, they leave, or they go somewhere else. This was a once in lifetime chance, I think. And I'm just kind of like, I don't know. For me, I think that plays into my experience as well. So that's my question, you know?

As a matter of fact, even talking about it now, my heart is really heavy. And so it takes me to a place where I say, as a woman of color, what could I have possibly done to maybe help to get some of those candidates over the top? I ask myself that question actually a lot. Because when I think of about it, it's somewhat hurtful. Do I think that we will ever be at a place where we could be so close now? I know that the two candidates that are in the running are considered women of color. I understand. From my perspective, as a Black woman, when I hear woman of color, I only hear Black. Black is women of color. I know that women of color can be... I'm pretty educated, I understand that. But so, yeah, I'm just a little confused a little bit. I'll get through it. But what do these folks have to offer to the community that I service? I didn't see any of them in my neighborhood of town. So it's interesting. And for someone who works for the state, it's even more interesting to me.

I also thought about the election. I'm coming from a little bit of a different position being that I can't vote, I'm not a Massachusetts official resident. But I feel sort of naive or ignorant in a way, because I didn't know much about the election and I didn't know much about the candidates. And I think that's the problem. So my question is, will there ever be any future initiative directed at young people living in the city, on this topic especially? Because even though I can't necessarily vote right now, whatever the outcome is of this election, or regardless, everything that's going on is still affecting me.

And that's just something that we have all been working towards as a group, especially here, towards changing.

I was in a meeting at the day after the election, I was in a meeting. And it was a community meeting and everybody was upset about the results of the election.

And I don't mean just treatment, but having things like there's something called the housing first model where you don't put a ton of rules in front of someone and say, \"You have to be six months sober or you have to stay in the shelter for three months before we'll fill out your verification of homelessness form.\"","d0":2.0096213818,"d1":3.2015323639,"textlen":162},{"conversation_id":1484,"index_in_conversation":80,"speaker_id":33580,"speaker_name":"Nancy","transcript":"All these things that just make it that much harder.

The thing at the forefront of my mind is housing and to people being able to be home and feel home and have security in their homes and have their neighborhoods be familiar.

We used to go into Lower Allston or even Little Italy or even North End, and those kind of areas, you don't really see any of these operators or even businesses in that area.

There's things of that nature, where we are all implemented in, but at the same time, we can't just all cross each other's regions.","d0":1.1476476192,"d1":4.0840611458,"textlen":109},{"conversation_id":1484,"index_in_conversation":92,"speaker_id":33584,"speaker_name":"William","transcript":"So my thing is when is it that it's going to be acceptable as me as a Roxbury native, that I'm accepted in Downtown Boston? Now it's very hard because I know the city has different on plans where they're putting in new housings, they're putting in new programs that doesn't really abide by Boston residential people. It only abides by people outside of the city or the ones that are coming in because Boston is technically known as the hub.","d0":0.2802336812,"d1":4.2008075714,"textlen":81},{"conversation_id":1484,"index_in_conversation":93,"speaker_id":33584,"speaker_name":"William","transcript":"So being the hub, that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world.

So my thing is, when is it that the people from our city are going to be accepted in our city? Because we're the ones who make Boston real. We're the ones who make it, the way it is, the persona of being a Bostonian, is not these out of state people. That's my difficulty of understanding.

So the second part of this conversation is, we need to find someone in the group whose question or experience resonates with our own life. Address that person and tell them why their experience resonated with you, and share the story from your life that connects you with their experience? What are you hearing in people's experiences?

There's the economic factors, but too, I think it's like, as I was saying earlier, when I was asking my question was how do we make sure that actual Bostonians who've lived here, don't get left out. So many people move in and do finance and biotech and all of that stuff. Is it possible that we could actually make... I wonder, is there a way that you could make a residency preference for people who have been born in Boston or lived in Boston so many years, like on the affordable housing. Some way to keep the people who've been here 40, 50 years is one aspect. Like I said, I can go on and on about this house stuff.

When you think about homelessness and you think about people in this town, in this city, who are second generation homeless. I'm not talking about just falling off to a corner somewhere. But a homeless person, homeless family, has now raised children who are now homeless children and growing into adulthood and they don't have any perspective of shelter.

Because from where I started, where many of us have started, the number of units of housing have increased, but the number of homeless has increased even more so. And where is the answer? And I'm sorry for running long. But this makes me very angry and I try to manage my anger, but at the same time, it's real. It's real to too many people. And there has to be accountability, whether it's in the fifth floor of City Hall or the State House or something else.

And I know that those neighborhoods are notorious if you look into Boston history, but as of right now, it's very gentrified and what we will call it watered down, basically, compared to what odds are, well, just nothing but neighborhoods where people defended themselves at a certain type of period.

But I think regaining the city is what we need to do and it's a hard task because we have to go to many forces, many programs, even conversations like this helps a lot too, as well because them we as a people who live here and who understand what's going on, we're able to really fulfill what is needed.","d0":0.8828333616,"d1":4.7148299217,"textlen":142},{"conversation_id":1484,"index_in_conversation":118,"speaker_id":33584,"speaker_name":"William","transcript":"I feel like the city, there's a lot of things that's happening but it's not really necessary.

Like, the way that I felt is that they were assuming that I was less intelligent because I had an accent, or that my opinions weren't, that I didn't have a real understanding of the topic that I was talking about because of this, a little bit of like, what are you saying? What do you mean?

I came to this question because like I said, I have been lucky to grow up in Boston, whether it be in East Boston, Roxbury, Dorchester and now Kenmore Square. As a kid, we live in East Boston. My mom could barely make ends meet and was able to obtain section eight. But even having section eight made it difficult for her to be able to even work because while she was still working, she was raising three kids on her own.

It's obviously not fairly recently, but at one point, down there, it wasn't to the level that it is now. And I noticed that a lot of things changed, and I feel like the city was really trying to help and I think they made the issue worse. Because when I was working down there, staff would go out and they would clear people and they had people going down there cleaning up needles, and there wasn't this tent where people could go into with ... Basically, when you go in the tent, you can bring whatever you want. There's no search, whereas all the other facilities down there typically had search and now, they have these safe injection sites out in the street and I don't know many people who typically go to the injection sites. They're just hanging around in those areas, and I feel like the city didn't do any of them a service really.","d0":2.2406570911,"d1":2.8923552036,"textlen":175},{"conversation_id":1490,"index_in_conversation":147,"speaker_id":33619,"speaker_name":"Jackie","transcript":"Thank you, Jen.","d0":8.7912111282,"d1":6.6518902779,"textlen":3},{"conversation_id":1490,"index_in_conversation":148,"speaker_id":33625,"speaker_name":"Dan","transcript":"I'm guessing it's my turn.","d0":8.3677206039,"d1":5.3579759598,"textlen":5},{"conversation_id":1490,"index_in_conversation":149,"speaker_id":33619,"speaker_name":"Jackie","transcript":"Yes.","d0":-7.2022776604,"d1":-7.1633806229,"textlen":1},{"conversation_id":1490,"index_in_conversation":150,"speaker_id":33625,"speaker_name":"Dan","transcript":"All right.

I'm going to stop talking and count to 60. So I'm going to model what I'd like us to do in the next 30 minutes or so. My question is, is there a place for working class families in the city of Boston? And what led me to that question was two things, in my own personal experiences. First of all, knowledge is definitely power. I did not know about home ownership and what you needed to do that. Turns out I had what I needed, I just learned about that, in a period where the housing market had escalated and I didn't earn enough to buy a home in the city.","d0":0.2603846788,"d1":4.2313542366,"textlen":114},{"conversation_id":1495,"index_in_conversation":37,"speaker_id":33649,"speaker_name":"Fran","transcript":"And I've moved about 28 times.

So that is why my question is, where are working class families going to live in the city of Boston and based on my own personal experiences moving about 28 times and being gentrified and displaced, because I'm not a homeowner.

And actually, my question was very similar to that. So specifically, as I'm still formulating what it would sound like is, how can we make Boston not only affordable for a future, but also accessible? And my personal reason is because I also still live at home. And if I am deciding to move out, I can only afford places that are outside of Boston and very, very outside of Boston. And I'm finding that a lot with other folks that I grew up with who live here. Many of them who have finally gotten their places, had to move at least an hour outside of the city, and if they work in the city have to commute.","d0":0.1814691424,"d1":4.008992672,"textlen":122},{"conversation_id":1495,"index_in_conversation":39,"speaker_id":33652,"speaker_name":"Ashley","transcript":"And so just wondering, not only about the affordability, but accessibility, because it's one thing to make it affordable, but then it's those folks who are not in the city, who are swiping those up and we are left with what's leftover. So just making sure that those who are from here who are looking to stay here have that accessibility to affordable housing that's livable and even just the idea of homeowning and what's needed, the education that needs to go in, early on, because things are not really brought up until you start talking about it.","d0":0.9959807396,"d1":4.6648712158,"textlen":98},{"conversation_id":1495,"index_in_conversation":40,"speaker_id":33652,"speaker_name":"Ashley","transcript":"We talk to our young people, our youth about being financially intelligent and knowing how to set up their finances, but we also don't know what it takes to apply for a mortgage?

So my question was along those lines, but it was more like, how will we close the income gap in the city of Boston? And that goes towards housing, education, work and what's actually available? It's speaks to all the issues that we have nationwide, especially when you look at the distribution of wealth and how huge that divide is where just a handful of people owe more than 40% of the wealth in the United States and how are we going to move forward as a society if we continue to invest in a form of capitalism that obviously isn't working for most of us and hasn't been working for most of us.

I've had different jobs in different industries. And we teach our students that if you work hard and invest in yourself at some time down the road, you're going to be able to have financial stability. And that is such a scam that we teach young people, because it doesn't matter what industry you're in, there are so many barriers. I've had a ton of career just roadblocks because I'm a woman or because I'm Asian or because there's a misunderstanding about my level of education or knowledge. So there's all of these little roadblocks within individual experience that we don't address and when you keep telling people that you work hard, you'll get there.

That was the closest place that they could find affordable housing in the early 2000s, to support a young working class family with three children.","d0":0.1847496629,"d1":4.4517192841,"textlen":85},{"conversation_id":1495,"index_in_conversation":65,"speaker_id":33650,"speaker_name":"Lauryn","transcript":"And now moving back towards the city is not an option for me personally, just because of the cost of housing, as previously mentioned. And I think that this is a extremely pressing issue, just because I think there's this attraction to Boston from top talent, for our top universities, for medical care for these hospitals that young doctors want to work at. All of these great, like high-end resources that are attracting outside talent, when there's also that talent within Boston.","d0":0.3374364078,"d1":4.0531148911,"textlen":82},{"conversation_id":1495,"index_in_conversation":66,"speaker_id":33650,"speaker_name":"Lauryn","transcript":"I think there needs to be more of an effort to provide those resources to people who are from Boston and willing to put in the work, because there are students in Boston Public Schools, in the Boston Metro Area that are willing to do that. But living in Boston just isn't an option because of the cost of actually living in the city and being close to those amenities outside of living with family or friends. And so I think that just in terms of attracting talent and retaining that talent, it's extremely important to maintain that affordable housing.","d0":0.4529897273,"d1":4.0610923767,"textlen":100},{"conversation_id":1495,"index_in_conversation":67,"speaker_id":33649,"speaker_name":"Fran","transcript":"Thank you, Lauryn.

I have a billion questions. So that was hard to come up with one question. So my question is in regards to marginalized communities and populations, what will their platform look like collectively, more so around expression, real inclusion in policymaking and education? And I guess, the experiences are with the education pieces, just seeing how the curriculum in BPS, and I'm not knocking BPS, but seeing how the curriculum doesn't seem like it's in alignment with general higher education. So we have a lot of failures at interest rate or the transition part between high school and college. Seeing those, it's kind of weird to me.","d0":2.0602674484,"d1":4.7866315842,"textlen":109},{"conversation_id":1495,"index_in_conversation":69,"speaker_id":33651,"speaker_name":"Malcolm","transcript":"And expression in terms of like arts.

One, specifically in South End, I don't want to go too much in detail, but just seeing how developers and just leaders of the communities and seeing how they can... It seems like the actual people live in the communities are actually marginalized, even within the community meeting. So a lot of things that are important to them that they collectively think are important, it seems like it's not paid attention to these policies happening, these things happening, they get moved out.

What Ivy said and as well as what Jaimy has said now resonated with me on that immigration piece. I think that as immigration reform continues to grow, there needs to be a shift so that there aren't certain countries of origin that are favored over the other. And there needs to be measures in place to reduce the bias of certain countries of origin. And certain cultures coming to the United States and to Boston in general.

A lot of students that was really the one thing that they pulled out of that workshop was, \"Oh, when you own a home, it just changes everything.\" And it's something that you don't really realize.

When it comes to looking for jobs and things like that, you need to degree or even you need a certificate. And not having access makes it that much harder. But seeing working with students, getting into these colleges, there may be a couple of colleges that may seem oh, it's very easy to get in. It's easy to get accepted, yada, yada. But as you're working through the transition process, you find out, you easily got accepted, but now you have to jump all of these hurdles.

Yeah, that's a huge. It's a huge issue. And I know a lot of people that have to move outside of the city, not just to rent, but also just to buy their home.

And it is really hard just seeing an entire country that's on fire but it also gives me hope in being surrounded by everyone here today who are just very justice-minded and wanting things to get better and wanting to do the work to make a more just society. So that gives me a lot of help.","d0":2.7370910645,"d1":4.5901727676,"textlen":117},{"conversation_id":1495,"index_in_conversation":110,"speaker_id":33649,"speaker_name":"Fran","transcript":"Thank you, Ji.

But my question is... Or I don't know. How we can divest from police and put that money toward communities and into communities while upholding a feeling of safety for everyone. Yeah. And so my background in arriving at that question is I guess, my engagement in racial justice groups and more recently, organizations focused on prison abolition and de-carceration efforts, and more recently transformative justice work and just kind of thinking about alternatives to what is very harmful sort of police and prison reality that we are existing in. So yeah. I would be curious to hear I guess from one like mayor or something along those lines, what their response to that would be, and yeah. How we can be moving some funds from police departments into the community.

I was at a conference on Saturday, and that was one of the questions that came up around policing and the funding the police and feeling that the whole policing thing needs to be reformed and they need to be reeducated and they need to allow other professions to come in and do their jobs around mental illness.

Do we have any prison rights? Because there's been a lot of issues around that, and how do we approach this? How do we expose information? And let me just redirect to the point. South Bay, right up the street for me pretty much, 15 minute walk. Recently they've been protesting over there because there have been 14 deaths, serious. And it's just being exposed. There's a lot of things around that. 14 deaths and they want to shut down. People, family members are protesting every day because they're saying that their loved ones are not safe. And I could find out, but I don't know at this point how many were women, but I think the majority of them were women. And so, because of that, that really hits home.

And I say that as someone who lives in Roxbury, not far from the, what's termed the mass and cast area, and it is appalling, how people are being treated and how we are treating residents of our city and our state down there. And I feel in some respects, it has become an almost out of sight out of mind, even though it's not out of sight because it is literally in the street. It is in the McDonald's bathroom folks shooting up. It is on the highway. It is on Southampton. It's on Topeka. You see the tents. And so that would definitely be my question, particularly for the future of our city, is how are we really going to address addiction issues in a humane way and in a more than rhetoric way.","d0":2.0894563198,"d1":2.7998597622,"textlen":171},{"conversation_id":1497,"index_in_conversation":50,"speaker_id":33665,"speaker_name":"Brandy","transcript":"And then the second question that I would have have is, how do we truly address climate change and the changing climate in a way that does not just create additional problems? So we can not just say we're going to address climate change by having electric vehicles, because that does not solve the fundamental problem of how do we get away from our dependency upon cars and traffic density. So it's one of those things and particularly because we are a city at and below sea level, this is a real question, and it does become an environmental justice question too because different pockets and areas of our city environmentally are worse off now than other pockets. And some of that is related to class and race and other things. And so as a city, how are we going to really truly address climate change and get serious about it, and not just be rhetoric.","d0":1.0073795319,"d1":3.6193990707,"textlen":156},{"conversation_id":1497,"index_in_conversation":51,"speaker_id":33665,"speaker_name":"Brandy","transcript":"It cannot just be play planting trees.

So I'm going to post them in the chat but I'm also going to read them, but you're not really expected to answer one particular part of this section but mostly just to have the conversation kind of touch on these.

The topic and the questions are also posted in the chat if you want to reflect. I'm going to sit back like I just did and let you guys kind of navigate the conversation, and I'm going to start the conversation off with Yvonne Long, and don't forget to pass the mic.

And I was unable to do that the first time around. So I'm trying to get my strength up again, and this is very personal to me, to try to make it happen again before Winter hits.

And I feel like if we were doing something about it early on, it would never have gotten to this point. But it had as now and it really needs to be dealt with, with government. I mean, it's not just a state issue. It's not just a issue that needs to be sat down and worked out between the counselors. This is a higher federal situation which involves a class up step from the governor, the attorney general I think, and then you had some deaths. We've had a lot of deaths that haven't even been mentioned about, but some of them were severe enough to hit the news.

Is it our job to just step up and take over and say, okay, this person needs to be sanctioned, or do we let them just keep continue on and then watch them just die? So this is what I'm saying. It's our job as a city to step up, unless we want to, like at the conference I went to, this very question came up and people were saying, well, if we opened up Long Island again and we should have, but Long Island has been closed for a while now.","d0":2.1678500175,"d1":2.7965428829,"textlen":139},{"conversation_id":1497,"index_in_conversation":62,"speaker_id":33667,"speaker_name":"Vonnie","transcript":"To me, I feel like Long Island was just the band aid.

I think we should step in and say, okay. This person needs to be sanctioned. Everybody deserves a chance. And to me, that would be the most insane humane thing to do, is to start having individuals sanctioned. So that they haven't chance because if they're not, then they just going to die.

He says, \"You were driving too fast.\" And of course I was already taught, given the talk, you show respect, you show difference. I'm like, sir, we were going 40. I clocked it, all that good stuff.

Like why did it take me so long to come to that realization, and why are certain people highlighted and certain people are absent from the studies that I experience and stuff like that.

So when you do your research, one particular politician, God rest his soul, who I had the opportunity before he passed to be in the presence of him, and this was probably about seven years ago.

I graduated two years ago from Boston Public High School. And I felt that my high school compared to other high schools in the Boston area, didn't receive as much funding. We're located I know in Newbury Street and I know a lot of the people that lived in that area didn't want my school to be there. So I don't know if that had any play in how much money we got because I know other schools like East Boston High got a lot of money. They went on field trips, almost once every two months.

We legit only had one field trip to a woman's basketball BU game, one, in my four years of being in the high school, that was the only thing. And we will also wouldn't have soap sometimes, in the bathroom. I don't know, what was up with that either.

One of my question will be in transit. Boston, Massachusetts, the population is growing so fast and the traffic every day, it's getting worse and worse. Do they have any plan in place where they are going to eventually improve it?

They will not be able to afford rent, houses. Because again, Massachusetts' population is going so fast and the rent is crazy high. The reason why I think about that because myself, so I've been looking to buy a house, almost for a year. I haven't been able to find one because it's crazy, they have too much demand and they don't have too many offers. Are they have any plans in place? Are they thinking about doing something and that way they can improve that, make it more accessible for the people to be able to afford a house?","d0":0.1421037316,"d1":4.3912682533,"textlen":120},{"conversation_id":1499,"index_in_conversation":89,"speaker_id":33672,"speaker_name":"Elvis","transcript":"Okay. Give us details of how bad traffic is. When you guys share these answers, we want to make sure that you guys give us as most possible details that you guys can just so we have as much information.

Now, it's taking me an hour and a half. So that is a huge change right there because now that everybody has started going back to work, going back to in-person school, the traffic it's being affected. Everybody has a car. They either have to stop selling car to people or find a way how to create different roads, something in order to deal with this problematic.","d0":1.2828804255,"d1":3.3548414707,"textlen":104},{"conversation_id":1499,"index_in_conversation":91,"speaker_id":33672,"speaker_name":"Elvis","transcript":"Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much for that. Now that you guys gotten a little bit of feeling of what we're doing and now we had answer questions and the context of what is the purpose of what we're doing here tonight, are there any questions about this process? Okay.

This is why we hired you guys think about the questions that you were going to share with us and the experiences that got to arrive at that particular question. So within the group, that we just went around, we asked our questions, we shared our experience, find someone. I know that you guys cannot get up and go around. But when I say find someone is from the conversation, from the questions and experiences that you have heard today, I want you guys to think about one person's experiences and questions that resonates with you in your own life. Then I want you to speak to that person and tell them why their question or experiences resonated with you and share the story from your life that connects you with their experience.","d0":4.8948531151,"d1":4.5248584747,"textlen":151},{"conversation_id":1499,"index_in_conversation":93,"speaker_id":33677,"speaker_name":"Yomaira","transcript":"Sorry.

Herschell spoke about how it was like, what was the educational system. Then Alejandro spoke about the educational system from a student's perspective that didn't get as much field trip, that felt that his school didn't get as much funding. And then you shared with us, your traffic and your commute and the fact that you've been looking for a house for over a year now. And there's just so many people moving into Boston and there's not enough constructions and new buildings coming up. So we want out of those three questions and experiences for you to pick one, either Alejandro's or Herschell's experience in question that resonates with you.","d0":5.0088825226,"d1":3.762996912,"textlen":115},{"conversation_id":1499,"index_in_conversation":95,"speaker_id":33672,"speaker_name":"Elvis","transcript":"And then we want you to take a moment and then reflect on those two things.

Actually I think that I can answer to your questions right now. Which actually, I think it was Alejandro, the first one with the education gap. That's something that I resonate to myself because like example about it, I have a child of my own, which I decide to he was going to school here in Boston Public School and then I took him to the North Redding Public School System and they're difference on the education is huge. The funds that they receive versus the lack of funds that they have here in Boston, there is a huge difference.","d0":1.9997081757,"d1":3.8357596397,"textlen":104},{"conversation_id":1499,"index_in_conversation":97,"speaker_id":33677,"speaker_name":"Yomaira","transcript":"I don't know his name, the first one, was talking about that gap, where in their education that they received, it shouldn't happen. It shouldn't be that way. I think that everybody should be receiving the same type of education, because everybody have that right to receive. We all pay our taxes, we all here in our society, trying to do better trying to sustain, try to make a difference, just depending on what side of the city do you live in or is it if you have money or not.","d0":1.8364521265,"d1":3.8055644035,"textlen":91},{"conversation_id":1499,"index_in_conversation":98,"speaker_id":33672,"speaker_name":"Elvis","transcript":"Thank you.

And when we both finished school, we're looking to get a house here and we've been searching and it's very challenging. I mean, we're coming from Indiana, the cost of living is not as bad home as it is here. But to even think that two thirds of everyone that lives in the Boston area, rent their house and they don't own it, that let you know that they just cost a lot of money. So it's like, I don't know if that could be fixed, but it will make a lot of people's life easier if it was.","d0":0.1674725264,"d1":4.7312178612,"textlen":116},{"conversation_id":1499,"index_in_conversation":104,"speaker_id":33672,"speaker_name":"Elvis","transcript":"Excuse me.

So what Yomaira has said earlier about the traffic that I can touch on that because in EC where I live right now, they're building... Every month, it looks like they're just building something new. And the traffic here has gone up by a lot. A couple years ago, it might have been a little bit bad, but now it's pretty bad. Especially in the mornings, when a lot of people that bought all these new apartments here, they usually go work in the city. So the tunnels, it's crazy, man. It's jam packed in the morning. So I think they should figure out a way, I don't know, maybe make a new road or something to help the traffic in that area. So yeah, I feel that's a pretty big problem right now, at least in East Boston. I don't know about other parts of Boston.","d0":1.0181742907,"d1":2.8264944553,"textlen":149},{"conversation_id":1499,"index_in_conversation":110,"speaker_id":33672,"speaker_name":"Elvis","transcript":"So you feel that if there's less construction, it would equal less traffic or how does that impact you?

We have heard that traffic, housing, our educational system. So I want us to take some time to think about what we're hearing.

And I feel like that probably has a lot to do with the fact that there's so many new buildings being built in Boston, East Boston, South Boston. When you have all these people moving in and you're pumping so much money into one space, the rent is bound to go up. And then that leads to usually, people of color and minorities getting pushed out due to all these people moving in because now they're not able to pay on rent anymore. They're used to paying X amount or something low and now the rent is increased and they can't afford it. They can't live like that.","d0":0.7533644438,"d1":4.5487155914,"textlen":129},{"conversation_id":1499,"index_in_conversation":120,"speaker_id":33673,"speaker_name":"Alejandro","transcript":"I know a lot of my friends that do rent in East Boston, they say that it's really, really high. And usually they have to have roommates. It's not like they could just live by themselves. They need maybe two or three roommates. So I feel like it shouldn't be like that. So we could just find a way to fix that. And make sure that on people in our communities, people of color, minorities are not getting kicked out or we can at least give them some type of assistance to be able to pay the rent. I feel like that would help out a lot of people.","d0":0.2373743951,"d1":4.6948328018,"textlen":109},{"conversation_id":1499,"index_in_conversation":121,"speaker_id":33672,"speaker_name":"Elvis","transcript":"Thank you so much, Alejandro.","d0":8.8973703384,"d1":6.5655984879,"textlen":5},{"conversation_id":1499,"index_in_conversation":122,"speaker_id":33673,"speaker_name":"Alejandro","transcript":"Thank you.","d0":11.5565719604,"d1":-12.9528932571,"textlen":2},{"conversation_id":1499,"index_in_conversation":123,"speaker_id":33672,"speaker_name":"Elvis","transcript":"Whoever wants to take the floor next.","d0":7.9760203362,"d1":6.0013542175,"textlen":7},{"conversation_id":1499,"index_in_conversation":124,"speaker_id":33676,"speaker_name":"Herschell","transcript":"I hear from everyone that education is important.

So it's over 80% people of color. But there wasn't a lot of black males working there and there wasn't a lot of black females working there. And it's like, some of the teacher couldn't relate to.

So, this conversation is less focused on debates and who the candidates are, more so it's focused on sharing your personal stories and experiences living here.","d0":2.3252196312,"d1":6.0105733871,"textlen":98},{"conversation_id":1503,"index_in_conversation":4,"speaker_id":33697,"speaker_name":"Rebecca","transcript":"And so, we're doing this so we can help build connections with one another and foster conversations to help improve our understanding of one another, and the situations that we're in.

Because I feel like I am learning something new just about the city, just by being here.\" And then at the end, \"You'd say with that, I'm in.\" Do all of you understand? All right.

Okay. And now we know that everybody's here and we know who's here, now let's get to the core of our conversation. And so, as we start to emerge from the pandemic, it's easy for us to lose sight of what we've learned about what's going on, particularly the inequality that's in America and in Boston, and how our lived experiences have shaped our thinking. And so, keeping all of this in mind, I'd like to invite you to think. And if you need to, grab a pen and paper, or anything that will help you do that.

And it's important to keep your experience personal, it has to be something that you've either experienced directly, and that doesn't mean to be a particular action.

But I don't know if I took this question in the right direction. So as I share, you can probably just let me know, \"This is not what we want. This is not what we mean, this is not what the conversation is about.\" So my question about the future of Boston is more related to me. Will I be here long term, will I be able to just, I don't know, settle here? Will I ever feel at home? I don't know, that kind of thing.","d0":-0.1683872193,"d1":3.6526265144,"textlen":88},{"conversation_id":1503,"index_in_conversation":34,"speaker_id":33697,"speaker_name":"Rebecca","transcript":"And what made you think of that question, from your experiences?","d0":5.1761374474,"d1":3.0681722164,"textlen":11},{"conversation_id":1503,"index_in_conversation":35,"speaker_id":33701,"speaker_name":"Randy","transcript":"So what made me, I haven't answered that one, but just on the fly, what made me think about that question is just like, I don't know, houses are expensive. I don't know. I just, I really don't know.","d0":0.1907530427,"d1":5.079834938,"textlen":39},{"conversation_id":1503,"index_in_conversation":36,"speaker_id":33697,"speaker_name":"Rebecca","transcript":"No, that's a legitimate answer.

So my question was basically, will there be more events held between different neighborhoods? Could be focused for example, on volunteering, and basically more educational realm that would help, for example, underrepresented neighborhoods. And I guess the experience I had coming to Boston, for example for college, when I came in 2016 to Northeastern, I always heard about the different neighborhoods within the area. But everyone is just like, \"Oh, go to this neighborhood, then go to that neighborhood.\" And I think people don't think like why different neighborhoods are different. And I one of the things we always noticed, is just differences in education, differences in support system within each community. And I think like all these things make me think of how each community, with more help or with more funding, can be helped more. And have, for example, more safety within Boston.","d0":0.9689341187,"d1":3.6102805138,"textlen":146},{"conversation_id":1503,"index_in_conversation":38,"speaker_id":33700,"speaker_name":"Jason","transcript":"And I think a lot of people have concerns about going to different neighborhoods, just because of what they think that neighborhood is, or what each neighborhood could be like. And especially coming from abroad, everyone's tells you not to go to a certain neighborhood within Boston, or they just say, \"Oh, all this neighborhood is just the same way.\" Which is definitely not true. So I think my experience is just, I believe although it should be within, I guess, the authority of the City of Boston in general to help. But it could also be people just volunteering and getting together from different neighborhoods, to actually build the community together and make a better Boston for themselves. Not just by just hoping that it'll become better somehow.","d0":1.2919238806,"d1":4.5139765739,"textlen":129},{"conversation_id":1503,"index_in_conversation":39,"speaker_id":33697,"speaker_name":"Rebecca","transcript":"Yeah, thank you.

A little bit of what was mentioned earlier about affordability, but for me personally, being more trying to figure out what the best word would be, but I guess accessibility in essence. And in particular with young families. So you have the Lead laws for housing, and we were ghosted by realtor brokers and homeowners when we were looking for places to live here in Boston. Because we have a toddler, and we'll have another toddler in our home shortly. And they don't want to rent to us because of the Lead law compliance, which is not fair renting practices. So it makes it very difficult to think of a future here in Boston, when you're dealing with a housing situation on a lease by lease basis, and not sure if you'll even be allowed, from the sense of a realtor or a homeowner, to even begin to look for places here in Boston. Which I think would be very important, to have families here in Boston of all types.","d0":0.7961672544,"d1":4.5129070282,"textlen":180},{"conversation_id":1503,"index_in_conversation":41,"speaker_id":33697,"speaker_name":"Rebecca","transcript":"I see.

That's just been a really harsh experience we've had here in Boston several times, so it comes to our mind quickly. But a question that I have about the future of Boston is, will it be more accessible for children and people with disabilities? And I think especially children. So in particular, I guess this relates to my experience, I'm a stay-at-home mom with a two year old. We have another child who is missing his arms, and other disabilities, coming to our family through adoption. And we spend most of our day at the parks, and most of the parks we go to that are in walking distance, he can't reach most of the stuff because he has to climb ropes, or poles, or things that his body just isn't able to do.","d0":0.6337069869,"d1":3.5750381947,"textlen":137},{"conversation_id":1503,"index_in_conversation":49,"speaker_id":33699,"speaker_name":"Haley","transcript":"And so, yeah, I guess that's my question. I think Boston has a lot of great, unique parks that for typically abled kids is really challenging and cool. But for children with disabilities, Boston can be a really hard place to be. The roads are tough, the buses are tough to access. A lot of the schools are really old, there's a lot of challenges if you do have handicaps in the city. So I guess for me, I wonder will our family be able to stay here long term, and meet the needs of our son?","d0":0.6871455908,"d1":3.6671464443,"textlen":97},{"conversation_id":1503,"index_in_conversation":50,"speaker_id":33697,"speaker_name":"Rebecca","transcript":"Thank you for sharing.

It's a much bigger city than Boston, but it has similar problems. And one of our biggest issues is housing. Especially because we understand housing and affordable housing, and I'm going to say what people believe should be housing for poor folks is just a place where they can live, even if that's a tiny box. Even if there's no joy in there, even if there's no access to parks, recreation, and socializing.

Again, I don't live in Boston, but I think this equally applies to any community, whether it's a high density of people who are African Americans, who are Latinos, who are Asian, who are people of color in general. And I can't help but to think that the same problems that, more or less, the same problems that people were dealing with 20 years ago in our community, people are still faced with today. And that's kind of the genesis of the question, and that is, \"Is there space for someone like me or my community in that future Boston, that future [inaudible], in that future whatever.\" Is there space and can we live there and feel like you can fully participate and be whomever we want to be.","d0":1.1638849974,"d1":4.10293293,"textlen":131},{"conversation_id":1508,"index_in_conversation":52,"speaker_id":33730,"speaker_name":"Francesca","transcript":"Want to share a little bit more about your own lived experiences in Boston area that led to that question?

The charter industry's still around, they're still pushing in a ways to fight[inaudible] from public education.

We're confronted daily with microaggressions. I see it today, I seen it 20 years ago in East Boston. So to me, it's an existential question that I think we're responsible to provide and answer to. And I think just doing what we've always done is not going to cut it. We're going to have to try to find different tools to do it, and also actually try to learn more about each other.

And the story behind it is we're seeing, and I have seen, I don't live in Boston, but I work very closely with the Boston community throughout my professional job and also through my organizing with the temporary protective status community, is that in the last decade, people have been priced out and forced to move out even when they call Boston home and have been living in the Boston area for years.

So I very much appreciated listening to all of you, of course. But I very much enjoyed listening to Jose and just as a Latino person as well, I have a lot of friends who live in not only Boston, but other cities in the U.S., including other countries, undocumented. It's so difficult to see how people are a part of these cities and a part of our communities and so much that happens in the city happens because of undocumented people. We're working, we're putting in the hours, we're creating families, creating culture, creating value. And how bad the city treats them back. And I know that I'm a privileged Latino because I have a Visa here, so it makes me think of our privileges, it makes me think of how the city can actually give back to the people who have created it, and not the country, which is pricing them out.

Housing is probably the number one priority, and adversity in every culture. Just having the tangible solution, I think Edwin spoke about employment, so that's stating these tangible things that are well needed, as well very much neglected in our city and that's part of the change that me, myself, I talk about as far as being a question and as far as my own life experiences.

And I think it's something, things happen in history, you have ups and downs that are patterns et cetera, but the truth if the matter is that if the pandemic exposed something, it's that these things is still very much here.

And if you even go deeper, it's usually the same politicians or the same characters that are funding something that is going to hurt us individually or as a community. But yet, we're only thinking Boston, I'm thinking about everywhere. But what if we thought about a regional approach. But that's what I mean by bridges and filling in the gaps.

Well, the things that everyone spoke about is something that I think we all has been dealing with for many years.

So you wouldn't be having this discussion, but here we are, I mean the same discussion. So my personal opinion is that I think you get to a point where it wears you down and makes you feel hopeless. I think what we probably need is some hope, a breath of fresh air. One of the things someone comment on, is the voting and everyone concentrate on the presidential vote. I think, I'm not speaking for him, but I think in my mind, when Obama was running, we were hopeful. \"Wow, things are getting better.\" And I think that's what we need in our community right here in Boston. We don't see things are getting better. We're not feeling it. So, we're kind of in the dumps a little bit.

Hi, wow.\" One thing about me is that if I'm accomplishing things and getting better, I want... in my business, if I'm making money, everyone else is making money with me, all my employees got to grow with me. So I don't have a problem bringing people along because I know where we're there's so much more we can actually do.

I hear it and it's sickening and I hate to say I got kids and I'm always concern of that about them, even though they're grown men and they're adults, but I am concerned. I would not want to experience what another parent is experiencing.

Because when you have the government giving people drugs and you expect them to come off of drugs, it's never going to happen. And that's why you got folks coming from other parts of the city into Boston, because the other parts of the city are not feeding them drugs, are not giving them that methadone, are not letting them just do what they want to do. Here we have other cities like [inaudible] and [inaudible] that said, \"Listen, no, y'all, can't come over here with that. We're not helping.\" But some of those are their people.

And that's why I said, if black folks come together, together, we can get things done, because there is a way to clean up, we have to stop feeding them drugs. You know what?

That's why they build a camp, that's a public sidewalk, so they can be there freely. They're out there. And the thing about it is you have drug dealers who are amongst them selling their drugs. You have shops over there at South Bay that I don't understand how they're still in business when them junkies going over there rob them every single day.

I tell people, you got to read it. The police reform bill going to hurt a whole lot of black security businesses.

And we have elected officials talking about defund the police. If you're talking about defunding the police and you're running for mayor, then you need to answer this one question, since you want to defund the police so bad, that means are you want to give up your detail security, which are police officers or your 24 hour security around your house to protect you and your family, are you going to give that up?","d0":2.126090765,"d1":2.5353732109,"textlen":139},{"conversation_id":1527,"index_in_conversation":138,"speaker_id":33872,"speaker_name":"Terrance","transcript":"Because what's going to happen, when you defund the security that some of us who are homeowners and we rely on, when we call that 911, the police isn't going to show up.

I don't want to go there. I don't want to talk to these people. I don't want to look at them.

It's key to keep experience personal. It has been something you experienced directly and experience that helped us understand how you got to the question that you shared.

So my connection to my question would be with Jamie. And I resonate with her question and her response, because that happened to my son as well. He was very social, and the pandemic really crumbled him down to almost just a shell.

And even as myself as a mental health advocate and counselor, it was hard for me to work from within the home because I'm always working with clients outside of the home. So when it hit home that my son was depressed and like, he just didn't want to get up for school. Like he would roll to the bed and wake up, turn the laptop on and be in class in the bed and just not present at all.","d0":3.2303159237,"d1":3.3690140247,"textlen":88},{"conversation_id":1528,"index_in_conversation":121,"speaker_id":33878,"speaker_name":"Charlette","transcript":"So it was so sad to watch that for, like, he struggled to get out of school. And the way the school system was set up, it was like they did everything to ease the kids so they could just get out. But to me, I still think that they weren't ready. The pandemic did push them back, but because of what was needed, like through policy or government, that they had to get these kids out of these seats for the next batch to come in.","d0":2.8030893803,"d1":3.1929912567,"textlen":87},{"conversation_id":1528,"index_in_conversation":122,"speaker_id":33878,"speaker_name":"Charlette","transcript":"And also with making them come back in this year, I don't know, to me it was like a force as well, because a lot of people are still getting sick. But just having that reflection of young people just going into a shell, it really resonated with me that that also occurred. And that was on the day of the shutdown where my son actually, he just went missing. He just kept walking around and hanging with friends. We had no idea where he was.","d0":3.7379255295,"d1":3.5622777939,"textlen":86},{"conversation_id":1528,"index_in_conversation":123,"speaker_id":33878,"speaker_name":"Charlette","transcript":"And that was the scariest time that I ever experienced something like that with one of my own children.

Because it was like, we couldn't find him, the pandemic happened, they sent the kids home, we don't know what's going on.","d0":3.6998529434,"d1":3.3113348484,"textlen":77},{"conversation_id":1528,"index_in_conversation":124,"speaker_id":33878,"speaker_name":"Charlette","transcript":"And it just was, yeah, bananas, pure chaos.

So I feel like, because I was trying to be hard on, \"You got to get up and you got to do school,\" it was kind of breaking her down.","d0":3.1875078678,"d1":3.2835576534,"textlen":98},{"conversation_id":1528,"index_in_conversation":128,"speaker_id":33875,"speaker_name":"Jamie","transcript":"Not able to see her friends, she's not able to do things that she normally does.

I mean, I can resonate on it because I mean, I feel like we all are mentally and physically going through the same things, because when you're depressed and that wears on your body, you don't feel good about yourself, you don't want to get up, you don't want to be active.

So first the purpose of this conversation, we want to create a new space across this city to facilitate more constructive listening across the divides. The neighborhoods, political and cultural divide, and provide improved visibility and accountability between the candidates and the future mayor and neighborhoods throughout the city. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. Those conversations are focused on shared personal stories from your lived experience, rather than entering the conversation with your position on the upcoming election or specific candidates. We are doing this to help build connections and foster conversations that improve our understanding of each other.","d0":2.1185913086,"d1":5.7726669312,"textlen":193},{"conversation_id":1529,"index_in_conversation":1,"speaker_id":33880,"speaker_name":"Marilyn","transcript":"Secondly, we want to address what will be happening with this recorded conversation.

The Local Voices Network is a web-based tool for accessing and exploring conversations designed by a nonprofit organization called Cortico.

And I'm checking in, I feel maybe intellectually today, because like I said when I came on, I felt like this morning being The Indigenous People Day... And that's rather new, but not so new. There's been little talk some years back, but never amplified to the point where it is today. And so listening to some of the radio cast today, it was interesting to me to discover how many people really didn't know history.

I listen to people and I think about where I am and I realize that spiritually, I am feeling particularly blessed because so many people... I've heard more about loneliness and separation and anxiety and what people have been experiencing over, through, around, about, and with COVID. And for me, that has not been my experience in my household with my husband and self, but my son and his fiance are also there. So it keeps things moving and quite frankly, I'd never really given that a thought until I started to hear the plight of others.

As we shed the restriction of the pandemic, it will be easy for us to lose sight of what we have learned about the inequality in America and Boston and how our lived experiences have shaped that learning.

When I was growing up, we had so many different centers where it was teaching us, keeping us off the street. We had different things that we could get into besides being on the streets.

It talks about the programs and things that we had initiated, such as Healthy Boston, [inaudible] Street. I don't know if you were around at that time? With Healthy Boston, a developed program that was called Ties that Bind. What the purpose of that was, was to bring an intergenerational component to children that were latchkey, what have you.

And the one thing that my father was constantly working to drill and instill in us is to know and to understand who's at the table. And he was one of those people that, if there wasn't a table, he'd build one. And you don't leave people out. The best way to have a community conversation is to have everyone from the community.

I can truthfully say to you now that I can't really walk out my front door and call anyone by name. My neighbor to my left has a lot of kids. And her kids call me neighbor, because I'll do stuff for them, I'll buy ice cream or treats or whatever, hand it to them.

It's got to have Gail on the call, and I should be on the call and Marilyn should be there. We need Shemeka and David to be there, to bring that perspective that oftentimes is beyond us because we are not thinking along that vein anymore. So we need to be cognizant of who's at the table, and then we need to make a concerted effort to make certain that if we're not there, we get them there.

Thank, you for sharing, Alveta. That was some really powerful stuff. I think what led me to my question... I've been working in one regard, the other with young people for the last 10 years and just doing life with them, spending time with them, mentoring, hanging out, just seeing this consistent theme of young people, especially brown and black young people, not feeling like they have anywhere to go when stuff is going wrong around them. And when they're facing a trial or something, or trauma or whatever it may be. So many times it's either they turn to their peers or they're keeping it in, or unfortunately, turn into other things to try and fill that void. And so I spent a lot of time working with young people in the context of the church. And so, a lot of it is spiritual-based, but as I grew older, I just really felt this need of, \"We can do more for these young people, than have them for two hours at a church service on a Friday night.\"","d0":3.4193480015,"d1":4.1641745567,"textlen":180},{"conversation_id":1529,"index_in_conversation":76,"speaker_id":33883,"speaker_name":"David","transcript":"And so for me, it was just very looking for, \"How do I find a holistic way to be of service to young people, to see them get access to more than just mental health resources, but healthier food, education?\" And even this past summer, I encountered so many kids who just legitimately so intelligent, so smart. Even more than me, but [inaudible] for them, they don't want to go to school, they don't want to take classes, but it's so... Just tension of seeing the brilliance in them, that the things that they're passionate about, they're so gifted in, but then just having no desire to apply to the certain areas in school, or you even just like...

And so being able to say, \"Hey, there is actually a path forward for me to success.\" And, yes, if that's[inaudible], but success doesn't have to be limited to getting a bachelor's. Especially in 2021, there are so many different ways that you can find success and make money and be happy and achieve all those goals.

But imagine that if we were in that time, when we actually made it a point to get to know people so that your street has an identity, your street has a culture. So that as people are coming in, it's not a chore to convince people to come to neighborhood association meetings, because the first time they see it or hear about it is not when you are shoving a notice in their mailbox, it's because you've actually had a conversation with them and you've mentioned it to them, you've told them about it.","d0":1.8234612942,"d1":4.8105926514,"textlen":149},{"conversation_id":1529,"index_in_conversation":126,"speaker_id":33884,"speaker_name":"Alveta","transcript":"So that when it happens, you can say, \"Oh, remember I told you about that meeting, would you like to come with me?\" And I think that we have moved so far...

Like, \"All right, let me come on this call.\" Not necessarily knowing what to expect, but it's truly been just a pleasure to discuss with everyone. It's just, hear everybody's viewpoint. Something I'm taking away from it, I think is really a renewed sense of commitment to building community. Like I said, \"It's so easy to just ignore those people that you might see on your street every single day or every [inaudible] you go to the grocery store, whatever, you always see these people and it's become so easy to just disregard that opportunity to build a relationship.

But I do believe that there are so many amazing people and resources already within our community and that we miss out on having those interactions and building those relationships when we're so closed off and just keep to ourself. So I'm really taking, just for me, just this idea of being more open to connections and not limiting it to... Obviously, I feel super comfortable with people my age, or obviously teenagers, because that's who I work with. But just being open to connections across all backgrounds, all ages, just really looking for that very just holistic connection with whoever comes into my life and whoever I interact with, in my community.

We don't really see it, but to know that there are conversations going on, and we can, if we just apply ourself to it, like David said, \"Be more open and not...\" I'm just grateful that I know that it's being... It's still talked about. It's not being ignored that things and changed have, did a big change. And I appreciate you guys, because if it wasn't for you guys, then we wouldn't know, or we wouldn't have the help... I'm assuming, and I feel like a lot of communities do not do this or reach out to each other and know anything about each other. Now if I see David on the street, I can say hi.

Oftentimes we come together, but it's always on somebody else's agenda. Never really speaking about what's on your heart, how you feel, how you see things. So, I can appreciate being here too and listening and learning as well, because I think that's the beginning of change. Understanding and knowing each other first and what people care about and how we work together to really affect change. Alveta.

So don't expect me to just say, \"Oh, I think I'm going to call Shemeka and see if she needs.\" Or, \"Oh, let me check in with Dave and see.\" I am telling you, call me. If there's anything that I can do to help you in any way, call me. Because I'm that person who you can call and you can talk to, and I really appreciate it. Marilyn will tell you, because I am that person who is task-oriented. Give me a specific thing to do. Don't expect me to pull it out of the air, but just know that I am here for you.

There's a lot of walks and different things for breast cancer and different things like that, but there's no things that minorities know about or feel comfortable participating in.

The idea here was to create an opportunity for people throughout Boston to actually have their voices heard. We targeted mostly what we call under heard voices. The people who in the midst of an election or other efforts in the city, don't necessarily get listened to, or don't have a platform that's really comfortable for them for saying what they want to say.

Then pushing those back out to the public, to news media and others to actually try to elevate and give lift to those voices. Tonight, we're going to be recording. I want to say a couple things about the recording. This is an audio recording only. When we finish, this will actually... I'll take this back and upload it on the web.

We say living, shouldn't do that, but they are living on local network. We're doing Real Talk as our conversations, there are hundreds of other conversations going around the country in different formats and different things, we can all reside in the same place together.

It's interesting, because it kind of ties into some of what has been shared. For me as someone who grew up in Boston, I went to Boston public schools, elementary, middle and high school. I left to go to law school in New York and enjoyed New York, because as a Latino man, I got to see a lot of similar situated Latinos like myself, who are professionals. I was inspired by their stories of how they became lawyers and judges, professionals. I felt comfortable in that environment. My question to Boston is, how do you make a city that I grew up in? A hospitable place for a Latino man? Who are now as two daughters, an 18 and 14 year old, who would love to have them stay and say Boston is my home.

Boston, how do you make this a place that I can enjoy playing, meaning going out, enjoying the place to go and have fun with families and others and friends? That's what I enjoyed in New York and sometimes I'm torn about moving back or moving elsewhere from a city that I grew up in. That to me is home, parents still live here. They're aging and I think I'm here because they're still here. But I'd swiped their parts, they'd miss New York City. For me, don't call me here in Boston very similarly.

Yeah, my experience is that for a long time, I was interested in doing broadcast journalism.

I know there is an office for immigrant advancement, and I know they do a great job supporting community organizations and distributing food, especially during the pandemic.

I feel the energy in my neighborhood and in Boston and this feels like a moment of change and I wonder how we actually translate that into casting votes. And I think... One more thing. I know, this is not all sort of city controlled. But the amount of frustration I feel projected at me when somebody comes in and can't vote or there's a registration issue, or can't drop off their mail in ballot at the location, have to go to City Hall, it just...

I guess my question for Boston is, what will it take to love Black people, the way rich White people love themselves? My experience as somebody that's been racialized White in this city, is that 450 years of White supremacy, bullshit lies, and the academy, and the fact that Judge Garrity in 1973, ordered 408 remedies for the school district to fix stuff for Black and Latino kids.","d0":1.5059534311,"d1":3.9204173088,"textlen":164},{"conversation_id":1623,"index_in_conversation":82,"speaker_id":34548,"speaker_name":"Becky","transcript":"I came through the school district when Judge Garrity was around, and I had friends that looked like people around this room and we all were excited about what we could get. because we knew that except for that tracking system of the advanced work and exam schools, working class White people weren't getting should either, the few that were left that didn't abandon the district. Because their children weren't better than Black children, and so until we face that reality I think, and I have not seen anything really since Malkin, Chapter and [inaudible] 20th century electeds, who had the analysis and operated from a place of love. They had a shared agenda of empowering all of us, so that we could all live in a beautiful city. So that our kids...

It helps you get educated, to have some of the degrees and so he'd work together to build that in the community of these storefront churches.

But there are many of other entities that do that, but the commonality of all this is that each one of us, we're a powerhouse and we can make these things happen, so the voice has to translate to action. In his case here, he'd always preached and wrote about the fact that the church has to go from preaching to acting, and the acting is an important part.

They projected a person sitting there telling their story about the Holocaust. It's really emotional when you can hear someone recount their own story.

But that thought is that as you explore that and as you converse, and you look at history, and you look at culture, there's all these different ways that we're kind of bound together where, \"Oh, we have a pancake in our culture too. We use it this. It's mooshy over here.\" \"Well, this tortilla from where I come from.\" Or, \"Over here, it's a wrap, but we call it different and this is how we say it, and we make it with this thing.\"","d0":3.9443387985,"d1":4.6253938675,"textlen":140},{"conversation_id":2836,"index_in_conversation":70,"speaker_id":49323,"speaker_name":"Born","transcript":"And so that there's these connections that we have that are things that bind us.

Like it's not to, \"We suffered, so everyone else will suffer.\" So that's the interesting thing, that's the beautiful thing that we don't want people to go through the same things that we've gone through, I guess.

There is no fence which can protect the passengers from falling to the subway, which I find is quite scary. Because inside China actually, the subway is always on time and also there are fence, double fence between, it's between doing different subways so that it can keep, even though sometimes can be crowded, that passengers cannot accidentally fall into the subway. I mean, fall into the slots which I find quite scary.","d0":1.1926034689,"d1":2.7009522915,"textlen":135},{"conversation_id":2837,"index_in_conversation":32,"speaker_id":49353,"speaker_name":"Dimitra","transcript":"So what would be your question?","d0":6.3956241608,"d1":3.6557264328,"textlen":6},{"conversation_id":2837,"index_in_conversation":33,"speaker_id":49358,"speaker_name":"Rukun","transcript":"My question is if it's possible that the government invests money to develop public transportation to improve safety.","d0":1.1531203985,"d1":2.6413617134,"textlen":18},{"conversation_id":2837,"index_in_conversation":34,"speaker_id":49353,"speaker_name":"Dimitra","transcript":"Great.

And I know with that comes a lot of concerns from residents, but this is land that has been used in the community. It's not necessarily supposed to just be for MIT's profit or something like that or MIT's development. So I guess, those are just my general concerns because I don't know what to do about that. As a student, I know I have a voice, but it's more like, how am I as a student going to say, hey, there are other ways that this development can be done that is not as, I guess, as much of a gentrifying force, and is including the citizens of Cambridge.","d0":0.6014238,"d1":4.0911383629,"textlen":165},{"conversation_id":2838,"index_in_conversation":71,"speaker_id":49321,"speaker_name":"Rebecca","transcript":"So I don't know.

So I moved to Boston four years ago, and I moved into Austin Brighton because that's where the internet said to move to and I forgot the internet is white. And a lot of the Black neighborhoods in Boston, they weren't even that far from me, but because Brookline juts in through Boston, there's very little transportation that goes through Brookline to get between where I live in Austin, Brighton to Dorchester and Mattapan and Roxbury and other Black communities in Boston. And so, to get there, I always have to travel into Boston, because this is before I was biking heavily, I have to travel into Boston and then out of Boston.","d0":1.0127432346,"d1":2.8243329525,"textlen":146},{"conversation_id":2838,"index_in_conversation":82,"speaker_id":49320,"speaker_name":"Gr3y","transcript":"I also had a friend from college. We went to school in New York five years ago, he was one of the few people that I knew living here, and he lived in Quincy for a while, and then he lived near the Wollaston T station, which, it's like South Dorchester. And again, for me to get to him, even though it's not that far distance-wise, was an hour 75 minute, sometimes 90 minute trip taking the trains. Which is, that's not even me taking the bus. And he lives close to the train station and I live literally across the street from the train station. And so, since that time, I've gotten very into biking and it makes it a lot easier for me to take direct routes, and I can cut through Brooklyn now that I know the roads, and I can cut through Dorchester a little bit.

People talk about Boston having a dead night life and not having activities or not having things going on, and partially that's because the train shut down early, but also it's because it does feel like the city only recognizes the activities that are happening in the downtown area. The businesses that are happening in the downtown area, and the different neighborhoods that exist in the city of Boston don't necessarily get reflection or promotion or credit from the city of Boston unless it's outstanding to a different level. Yeah, I think that some of that is structural in how the trains and buses and things move always, like you said, funneling towards the center. But some of it also is marketing and space giving, where they're only highlighting the things that happen there, which is why everyone's attraction and attention goes there when they could diversify and split where they show.","d0":0.9623261094,"d1":4.0547289848,"textlen":196},{"conversation_id":2838,"index_in_conversation":84,"speaker_id":49317,"speaker_name":"Zakiya","transcript":"Yeah, thank you.","d0":10.2583236694,"d1":4.0781168938,"textlen":3},{"conversation_id":2838,"index_in_conversation":85,"speaker_id":49318,"speaker_name":"Anisha","transcript":"I connected, Gray, with your experiences talking about both people here who are here just for college and their role in community, and then also related to COVID. I was doing some organizing work prior to COVID and some during it, but it felt really, very highly during COVID where people left to go home a lot. And because a lot of the young people in this organizing group, it wasn't just for students, but a lot of people were students, and it felt like discontinuous, kind of disjointed as people leave. And it's not really conducive to building long relationships, especially with people or groups who are based in Boston with people who've lived in Boston for a very long time and will continue to. And so it felt like, where is our place and can we really form partnerships with groups if the people in this organization are just going to keep cycling out every two or four years from school?","d0":2.4182200432,"d1":4.7214212418,"textlen":163},{"conversation_id":2838,"index_in_conversation":86,"speaker_id":49318,"speaker_name":"Anisha","transcript":"And I think, I hadn't really reflected on it this way until now, but I think part of the reason I paused doing stuff during COVID was, both because other stuff is happening in my life and its overwhelming, but also, I didn't really feel connected and then I didn't feel this ties of connection were strong enough to keep me doing that because of this kind of turnover.

So I guess I'm just concerned about, in terms of why this resonated with me, I feel like I don't really hear about it from, specifically MIT in terms of climate resiliency. I never really hear about anything that it's trying to do or how it's collaborating with the city of Cambridge or anything like that.

So I think, I don't know. It stresses me out because it feels like there's nothing... I know so many people that are very invested in this at the school, and also hear about it from groups in Cambridge, but in terms of the people who can do things about it and have the power to set these large scale policies, I feel like I don't really hear about it, and it worries me.

I'm talking about sea, the horizon. But the flooding is another issue.

Cambridge and Boston especially, and what's happening in the seaport, and invest a lot of money, and it's the most risky place to build. But when we coming to explain it as, we're getting money out of this, it's okay, because the developers were saying, we don't care.
