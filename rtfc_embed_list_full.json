I want to record these conversations, as I've told you before, and I want to share three things about what we do with the conversations. Okay? The first is in this room, we record the conversations.

If you want your whole part of the participation taken out, then what we have to do is take out everyone's, so we don't have any way to take one person out of the narrative structure, but if there's a particular thing and you say, \"Hey, I need to have that removed, I didn't mean to use that person's name,\" we can go in and do that. Also, when we're talking, you can use any name you want. We only use one name, so you can use just your first name or your last name or you can make up a name, if that works for you.

Usually the way we would do it is that whoever's hosting it, so like we're hosting here at the Neighborhood Center, right, we would give them the right of ownership of those conversations, so that if you wanted to change something, you would contact them and they would be the ones who would actually make sure that things got taken off and everything like that, but there's a default agreement that our system, which we call the Living Voice in this network, that these conversations will reside on that system, and right now, what that means is that the conversations will be public, okay?

The silos that we operate in Boston, everyone's doing their own thing but not knowing what each other are doing, and that trickles down to even families. Families don't talk to each other. They don't eat dinner with each other. I think the pandemic has caused us to kind of stop and look and see that we do need each other. We do need to kind of look out for each other, but when you said that, I thought about how when I went to Philly/D.C. and I came back here, it was just like, \"Ugh,\" you know?

I have a scratch because usually we do this on Zoom now and we tell you that we're going to throw in the video and only use the audio. So all we're using today is the audio. Okay? And...

It's an online forum that we are actually able to lift the recordings into, get a transcript of those and then that transcript in and of itself will be visible online.

What we're trying to do is honor the importance of small conversation, and then at the same time, be able to connect across small conversations to really make something much bigger. So what we're asking really right now is that as a participant in this conversation, that you are going to provide consent for Real Talk Boston to use and retain this recording in accordance with our mission. And that you understand that the conversation will be part of a collection of Cortico's Living Voices Network whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another.

Cortico is not going to own it. Community-based organizations are going to own it. And if you decide at any time you want to not be on the system anymore or something like that, you can turn to a community-based organization who can help make that happen. So that's the way that we're going to move in with that. So with that understanding, what I need to do is have each of you go around and say, if you are in agreement with this and you're willing to be recorded, and this is the last of the formality.

So in terms of the experience that I thought of, it's kind of a personal experience, but it's also a work experience because of the work that I do with nonprofits. So the experience I'm thinking of is a small community based nonprofit that I work with that was given a legislative earmark from a state agency. So we went to meet with the person to get it. It's like 50,000 bucks. It was like really good for the small organization. So we went to meet with the people to get the paperwork rolling and the person running the state program said, \"Oh, okay, well, this is a cost reimbursement contract.

So my question about Boston in whether the education system will ever so really become student centered and really get beyond some of the issues that seem to keep impede them from progress. These issues of skills with teachers and certain restrictions that happen. And so yeah, how do we move sort of beyond that is the question. And my experience is, in high school, I was in a Mass experimental school system and we had this system called the model high. And it was part of, like they had a lower school, middle and upper. And one of the things about it was that a lot of the young people that went, they went because they were either kicked out or had difficulty either learn differently or whatever in the traditional school system.

If you're really trying to understand what could be a more advantageous school system or whatever, and you put it with folks who, in a lot of way anybody whose kid was doing well in the traditional system wouldn't take them out and put them in an experiment. So we was filled with kids who had behavioral issues, or had some difficulty in a lot of ways in dealing with the typical system. And so that was one reason why I think that it never got on track because of the results. When I see that happening again, I see the same ideas about trying to open up the classroom and trying to not have grades and trying to design schools that try to meet the students where they are and just going through the same cycle.

So I can see firsthand of how home culture can get confused with school culture and the school culture is totally different and teachers are doing the best that they can, but there will never be a connection without that home culture. So that's where they misunderstand and misinterpret our children's signs. Somebody might see my son as aggressive, but it's probably passionate or a cry for, \"I don't understand.\" When you have teaching tools or you're trying to say, \"Okay, well, this kid needs to learn social, emotional growth and tools to voice what the issue is that all school year, you say, \"It's okay, you can be mad.

So it's to be able to see that and to go through some experiences as a mom of a black child with another teacher and see like whole, it's like, yeah, educational system use my languages like that because of the world spent, the teachers not talking to the parents and the parents are afraid of the teachers and the teachers are afraid of parents, but nobody is willing to tell them that. And the kid is in the middle, you can see his book. And the kid becomes smarter than both of the teachers and learn how to play, both of them by using the same policies that they implemented for the teachers and the parents to keep them safe.

I've seen it.\" And he's 10 and I've raised him to always voice how he feels. And so that might come off as smart remark or disrespectful, but no big deal at that point. It may come on to you.

I don't know how to like put it. So it's like, might've been these policies, like who makes these policies? Because I don't live in public housing. So public housing is a lot easier to pick up the phone and say, \"Hey, I think I have been racially discriminated,\" and they'll do something about it quicker, the private low-income housing. So that infrastructure too was just like, it's like, \"What?\" So they can take...

So the policy piece is really strong for me because it's like a lot of these people that make these policies and put them in place are not actually the people that live in through them. So it's just like, they don't know how that makes a person feel. And then again, you're raising family, you have to disregard all of that.

And I don't know if it's because people just didn't care or if it wasn't important to them, that it was important to us to get to where we needed to get to on time so that we can keep our jobs or that we don't have to experience detention in school. Because that was my issue back then when I did have an issue with the MBTA is that, if the bus was late and then crowded on top of that, it would just pass us by. And so, I would always get to school late and I don't care what time I got up to try to make it early if all the students trying to get to school early too. So, the buses were crowded, so they just keep going, you know? So, yes, I can resonate with both question and experience with the buses.

There's been a variety of cultures living together now, agriculture's going on where people are doing local farming and stuff. My concern is about the prices going up for the cost of living in Boston. And the reason why I care about this issue is because I lived in Boston independently as a renter for about a year. And living there as a renter, to be as a single person with no children, I found it to be a little bit costly.

We tried to score a bag of reefer or a gun on a Saturday night in the nineties, he was a Black man, I was a white woman. We couldn't find pot, but we found guns easily.

What I wanted to say the question that resonated with me is ironically yours, Fran, because I grew up in Mission Hill during the busing era. I moved here after living in Grove Hall and I came to shell shock because over there I had Black neighbors like myself and then I came here and it was primarily white. My first experience was going up to the playground in Mission Hill and having a white kid punched me in the face, no reason at all. And then our first encounter was my sister having to beat him up. And then in the fall, turns out that he's in my class. And so this is the beginning of my life as a middle schooler, listening to the stories of the high school and them having race wars and us fighting with our friends who were friends in school but as soon as we crossed the street from the Catholic middle school that we went to, then it was all hell that broke out.

So the systemic racism that exists now as the community and cultural engagement manager at Mass General hospital, I'm doing my best to break down a lot of those walls and having to fight with white people to get them to see why this is not a handout or a hand up, but it's just telling them that they as a system need to give back to a community that they've turned their back on for so many years.

We were all Black from the west side of Washington and the only way to get to Boston Bowl was walk. And we got jumped on our way coming back from bowling and car of young white men, young white boys jumped out and started to swing at us with golf clubs.

They really overlap with a lot of the different things that we are concerned about at this table right now. And if we can see the connection, you can see how important it is to act today. With mental health, we don't really see it as a job issue, but it really is because when lives are stable and incomes are comparable to the national average, lives are better and the stress is less and you don't look for self-medication and you treat your kids better. So the quality of life all the way around where all of these things seem seemingly not connected are very interwoven like a sweater.

Can I use your phone?\" And they was like, \"Oh, my phone's off. I'm going to go pay my bill now.\" So I was going to go with them to pay their bill. So I asked, \"Can I just walk with you or whatever?\" And they act like they didn't know me. So that led me to go to wait for them at their house.

It was more than one person attacking me. Someone called the ambulance because I was obviously beaten up and I had to go to Boston Medical and mind you, I still had no phone. And my family started worrying about me. They had to put a missing persons report because remember I had no phone, I wasn't home. And I was never able to use someone else's phone. And it bothered me that when somebody could be needing help or something and they knock on your door and the first thing you do is attack them, you don't try to give, you know what I mean, help them out and see if there's anything, if they need to use a phone or if you could show them where the ... just help out instead of ... like, the first instinct was for these people to attack me.

It's a pleasure having this conversation with all of you individuals that are participating. And my closing thoughts is I feel like I understand a little bit more about what we're doing here and I'm grateful for this happening because I believe this is a pilot for something that we might want to do again in the future, as far as getting voices of the community involved with what the mayor and what the political powers that be in our community can help us with or support us with or try to make some change. So I feel like this seems like a very good idea. I feel included. This is really an easy lighthearted conversation.

So for my question about the future of Boston would be what will... My concern really is, what will it look like with all these new developments and all these different, these new things that are coming up, these new ways of living in Boston. Like these new ways of telling the bus sizes, directions to each library locally, there's bike paths, there's limited parking, there's a lot of construction going on, it's a lot of buildings going up, there's a lot of stuff going down and being remodeled.

And the reason why I say this question is not just for me, but also I have peers, that they make too much money to be on housing, but they don't make enough to afford market rent. Also, for myself when I lived in Boston, I had to move every two years and I had trouble finding single apartment living for myself as an individual, whereas living in a studio was about the same amount of market rent for someone who had a three bedroom. So when I was paying 1200 for a studio, someone could pay 1200 and get a three bedroom. So stuff like that and the cost of living did go up and it was all over the news in the media about the cost of living in Boston going up. So that's my question and my story. And what how it affects me. So next would be Jackie.

So for those low income families. So I grew up right there Corner of Dudley and Blue Hill Avenue. And back then there was rent control. I remember I had a studio... I had a one bedroom apartment for $600. This is back in 1990, 1991 in that state and that was market rent. It was over at 420 Mass Avenue right next to the train station. And right now that same unit is $2200. That's a little bit out of the score. That's almost 80%. Right? So yeah, almost 80% more than...

I try to do some research on re-entry in prison and see what's out there and there's places that do stuff but, like George was saying, it's half ended. They have all these good intentions. They give us all these hopeful resources, but access to these resources and the practice of these resources once we have access to there's disconnect. And I think a lot of that plays a part on for me through my personal experience, through social workers and community engages how a lot of them are not hands-on only because everything is so paperwork. Paperwork pushing instead of actually being hands-on, one-on-one with individuals who walk them through these processes to re-entry them back into the community, whether it be from incarceration or mental health or homelessness or any of these things.

One of the things I'd like to leave as a thought that maybe we can all hold onto is that this gift of us giving people an opportunity to really have some ways to take from us is one of the most important and most visible ways today that I have seen that's going to help to assist them. And also give me a great way to just feel good about knowing that the work that I have envisioned and work I've done all my life is something and the stuff we've all done is something we should all be very grateful for and thankful for.

Thank you. I guess my biggest takeaway from this is that, like I said before, this seems to be a common thread that runs through us. And when I can remember coming up where I needed some help and there was no cultural competence, so there were no doctors or therapists that looked like me that I was dealing with. So there was a disconnect. And now all these years later where that's been addressed in some ways there aren't a lot of people doing the work that lived like me. And what I'm hearing from this group is that there are some common themes. And that gives me hope because where it was cultural competence before it's lived experience today that I feel like could really make the difference. So I'm happy to be a part of this as well.

We bring together old technology, which is sitting around and talking with food. That's old technology. It's ancient. It works. We combine it with some modern technology that allows us to record and hold onto these conversations and actually put them into a format so that they both are preserved but they actually can be analyzed and used for making meaning that can have an impact on policy, and how candidates themselves are thinking about what's on the public's mind.

The video recording will be discarded, and the audio will become part of a collection of conversations. The conversations, along with all the other conversations that are taking place throughout the city, will be shared with members of Real Talk for Change team members and others who have participated in conversations throughout the Local Voices Network, LVN.

LVN systems creates a transcript for each recorded conversation, and uploads both the transcript and audio recording to the Explorer tool.

I've seen a lot of people suffer just because they can't afford care, healthcare, and I've seen just the simple kind of care they need, so my concern is, what's the way forward? What's the plan in the future on how to correct that, and how can everybody access quality care being affordable to everyone? And especially during this time, with the COVID situation. So many people died, not because of the virus in itself, but also because they weren't able to get care.

They quickly know they have to pay a white business or a white person in that business, but for a black and brown, they wonder is it really cheap or a free service. And it's a challenge and it's very frustrating, because I have probably developed a strong network in my time in Boston and a lot of people want to tap into that network, but they don't want to pay.

There weren't fireworks, gunshots, whatever going off all the times of the day and night. There was a certain peace about where you lived. I know this is about our own personal experience but I'm going to share mine and my neighbors because it happened at the same time. So there was a shooting on our street a couple of weeks ago and it disturbed the neighbors and so much so that my elderly neighbors are like, if anything else...

Mental health is of great concern to me because my son he has battled it from several years following the death of his father. And if individuals aren't aware that mental health is important, they tend to overlook it and they tend to misinterpret another person's actions. And someone said to me recently that they have discovered that a whole lot of young people seem to be suffering from some aspect of mental illness, that there's a lot of depression, a lot of anxiety, a lot of young people experiencing panic attacks and so on. It has become, and these are not my words, but someone said to me recently, it has become almost epidemic now. So I believe that it's something that needs attention. And I think that even though it is right there, we're aware of it, we continue to overlook it. And of course, if you're not healthy mentally, nothing in your life works well. You aren't able to be successful in any of your goals.

It marginalized people of color, it marginalized women, marginalized LGBTQ, all that youth. And I think education is a source of all opportunity and all growth and all wealth.

So why is it that we don't have classes on financing? Why can't we teach cooking class? Why can we teach home economic classes? Why can we not teach our youth how to make a garden?

And I feel we see a lot of buildings and affordable housing units and all these things being pop up, but the demand for is still not being met.

And in a space where there's a lot of just disorganization, and they're not being honest about things. And they're saying, \"Oh, this person's rejecting it, and not creating a full picture.\" We're never going to be able to meet the demand. If the folks that you were doing business with, you're not making it clear to them that this is your expectation. And if you don't meet the expectation, the result is you will no longer have a contract as a property management company. And I feel just all around, there's just no accountability period for anyone.

But I didn't have a real, real job and didn't realize medical and health insurance was a thing because when you turn 18 you don't really care about all that stuff.

For me, Miss Debra, your story resonated with me when it comes to banking and loans and financing. So when I was growing up, when we first came to America from Haiti, my parents, we lived in Everett. And so I went to the Everett school systems. And once you get to high school, there was actually... Everett Cooperative Bank is within the high school. And that was a class that you take. And I took the class for two years. And so you go through the class, they teach you everything about banking, you actually do banking within the schools, kids have accounts and all that, once you graduate, they then position you into the actual branch outside, where you now have a job as you graduate, and you're going through the whole banking system.

Where are the conversations that are being had to know that everything is interconnected? So if you want us to be able to access the generational wealth, typically, in order for us to access it, we need to get a loan in order for us to make that purchase. And we know that through the banking system, it's very predatory practices, it's just absolute. Structural racism within the banking system is just out of this world. And I think that that's one of the ways that we need to make sure that we can start to attack some of the challenges and issues that we're having in our communities, you see more check cashing places than you actually see banks.

It's just taking your money and then not investing into any of the programming around you. And investing in anything that's beneficial for you. But meanwhile, you're giving them your hard earned funds constantly. And that's something that I would really love to see an elected, at least try to acknowledge or convene the banking systems in all the different places that we have, to start to have conversations on how do they better approach people of color, and making sure that the products that they have available work for us, and if our credit scores are not good enough, or we're not meeting the requirements, what programs do you have in place to help us get there?

Three, share time, allow others to finish speaking, take turns, stay courteous, ask honest questions, pause, take time for reflection, listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. When possible, close unnecessary program applications and notifications. That means you all's phones go on silent. If you need to take a moment to take a break, let the facilitator know.

And then the City's not tentative to the homeowners when they get into a serious situation.

To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation.

My question about the future of Boston and my place in this future is... I mean, my question is centered around the results of the primary of the election. I voted in the election.

I was excited to see, what, two Black... three Black people in the race, people of color, and to see the results where none of them actually made it beyond the primaries. My question is like, well, will Boston ever have a Black mayor? Are they even ready for a Black mayor? I say that with the full understanding of they had their...

I mean commissioner, excuse me. But basically had Blacks in every level of law enforcement at the highest level. I don't know. And I'm thinking like, will Boston ever have a Black mayor? That's why I checked in like intellectual. Because to me, that's something... I think this was the best chance ever to have a Black man and it never happened. I know that I've been in Massachusetts a long time and I've known somebody become the mayor, they're there till they die, they leave, or they go somewhere else. This was a once in lifetime chance, I think. And I'm just kind of like, I don't know. For me, I think that plays into my experience as well. So that's my question, you know?

And so it takes me to a place where I say, as a woman of color, what could I have possibly done to maybe help to get some of those candidates over the top? I ask myself that question actually a lot. Because when I think of about it, it's somewhat hurtful. Do I think that we will ever be at a place where we could be so close now? I know that the two candidates that are in the running are considered women of color. I understand. From my perspective, as a Black woman, when I hear woman of color, I only hear Black. Black is women of color. I know that women of color can be... I'm pretty educated, I understand that. But so, yeah, I'm just a little confused a little bit. I'll get through it. But what do these folks have to offer to the community that I service? I didn't see any of them in my neighborhood of town. So it's interesting.

Because even though I can't necessarily vote right now, whatever the outcome is of this election, or regardless, everything that's going on is still affecting me.

And that's just something that we have all been working towards as a group, especially here, towards changing.

So many people move in and do finance and biotech and all of that stuff. Is it possible that we could actually make... I wonder, is there a way that you could make a residency preference for people who have been born in Boston or lived in Boston so many years, like on the affordable housing. Some way to keep the people who've been here 40, 50 years is one aspect. Like I said, I can go on and on about this house stuff. It's close to my heart.

And it just to me feels like you've run out of options for where you can go and then you get stuck having to take something that you maybe might not be able to afford exactly, but you have to make do because the options are limited around here these days, and it's not terrible so I might as well take it, I guess.

And I noticed that a lot of things changed, and I feel like the city was really trying to help and I think they made the issue worse. Because when I was working down there, staff would go out and they would clear people and they had people going down there cleaning up needles, and there wasn't this tent where people could go into with ... Basically, when you go in the tent, you can bring whatever you want. There's no search, whereas all the other facilities down there typically had search and now, they have these safe injection sites out in the street and I don't know many people who typically go to the injection sites.

I've had a ton of career just roadblocks because I'm a woman or because I'm Asian or because there's a misunderstanding about my level of education or knowledge.

And there needs to be measures in place to reduce the bias of certain countries of origin. And certain cultures coming to the United States and to Boston in general.

A lot of students that was really the one thing that they pulled out of that workshop was, \"Oh, when you own a home, it just changes everything.\" And it's something that you don't really realize.

But seeing working with students, getting into these colleges, there may be a couple of colleges that may seem oh, it's very easy to get in. It's easy to get accepted, yada, yada. But as you're working through the transition process, you find out, you easily got accepted, but now you have to jump all of these hurdles.

Yeah, that's a huge. It's a huge issue. And I know a lot of people that have to move outside of the city, not just to rent, but also just to buy their home.

There's bodegas, there's restaurants, it just changes the vibe so much. And it just reminds me how, for me, I'm finding more strength in the community.

And so my background in arriving at that question is I guess, my engagement in racial justice groups and more recently, organizations focused on prison abolition and de-carceration efforts, and more recently transformative justice work and just kind of thinking about alternatives to what is very harmful sort of police and prison reality that we are existing in. So yeah. I would be curious to hear I guess from one like mayor or something along those lines, what their response to that would be, and yeah.

Do we have any prison rights? Because there's been a lot of issues around that, and how do we approach this? How do we expose information? And let me just redirect to the point. South Bay, right up the street for me pretty much, 15 minute walk. Recently they've been protesting over there because there have been 14 deaths, serious. And it's just being exposed. There's a lot of things around that. 14 deaths and they want to shut down. People, family members are protesting every day because they're saying that their loved ones are not safe.

And I say that as someone who lives in Roxbury, not far from the, what's termed the mass and cast area, and it is appalling, how people are being treated and how we are treating residents of our city and our state down there. And I feel in some respects, it has become an almost out of sight out of mind, even though it's not out of sight because it is literally in the street. It is in the McDonald's bathroom folks shooting up. It is on the highway. It is on Southampton. It's on Topeka. You see the tents.

So we can not just say we're going to address climate change by having electric vehicles, because that does not solve the fundamental problem of how do we get away from our dependency upon cars and traffic density. So it's one of those things and particularly because we are a city at and below sea level, this is a real question, and it does become an environmental justice question too because different pockets and areas of our city environmentally are worse off now than other pockets. And some of that is related to class and race and other things. And so as a city, how are we going to really truly address climate change and get serious about it, and not just be rhetoric.

So I'm going to post them in the chat but I'm also going to read them, but you're not really expected to answer one particular part of this section but mostly just to have the conversation kind of touch on these.

Like why did it take me so long to come to that realization, and why are certain people highlighted and certain people are absent from the studies that I experience and stuff like that.

Some places undesirable and then the place you were living in is too expensive. So then you go over here because it's a little less expensive, and then it becomes desirable. And so yes, there were certainly a lot of inclusion in terms of different groups being able to move in but it was also because it was affordable. It was cheaper than other areas because of the crime, because of the drugs, because of the labels people put on Black areas. And so even the area I lived in, Fort Hill was not desirable.

So when you do your research, one particular politician, God rest his soul, who I had the opportunity before he passed to be in the presence of him, and this was probably about seven years ago.

I haven't been able to find one because it's crazy, they have too much demand and they don't have too many offers. Are they have any plans in place?

So that is a huge change right there because now that everybody has started going back to work, going back to in-person school, the traffic it's being affected. Everybody has a car.

So what Yomaira has said earlier about the traffic that I can touch on that because in EC where I live right now, they're building... Every month, it looks like they're just building something new. And the traffic here has gone up by a lot. A couple years ago, it might have been a little bit bad, but now it's pretty bad. Especially in the mornings, when a lot of people that bought all these new apartments here, they usually go work in the city. So the tunnels, it's crazy, man. It's jam packed in the morning. So I think they should figure out a way, I don't know, maybe make a new road or something to help the traffic in that area. So yeah, I feel that's a pretty big problem right now, at least in East Boston. I don't know about other parts of Boston.

And I feel like that probably has a lot to do with the fact that there's so many new buildings being built in Boston, East Boston, South Boston. When you have all these people moving in and you're pumping so much money into one space, the rent is bound to go up. And then that leads to usually, people of color and minorities getting pushed out due to all these people moving in because now they're not able to pay on rent anymore. They're used to paying X amount or something low and now the rent is increased and they can't afford it. They can't live like that.

So we could just find a way to fix that. And make sure that on people in our communities, people of color, minorities are not getting kicked out or we can at least give them some type of assistance to be able to pay the rent.

So it's over 80% people of color. But there wasn't a lot of black males working there and there wasn't a lot of black females working there. And it's like, some of the teacher couldn't relate to.

So my question was basically, will there be more events held between different neighborhoods? Could be focused for example, on volunteering, and basically more educational realm that would help, for example, underrepresented neighborhoods. And I guess the experience I had coming to Boston, for example for college, when I came in 2016 to Northeastern, I always heard about the different neighborhoods within the area. But everyone is just like, \"Oh, go to this neighborhood, then go to that neighborhood.\" And I think people don't think like why different neighborhoods are different. And I one of the things we always noticed, is just differences in education, differences in support system within each community. And I think like all these things make me think of how each community, with more help or with more funding, can be helped more. And have, for example, more safety within Boston.

And especially coming from abroad, everyone's tells you not to go to a certain neighborhood within Boston, or they just say, \"Oh, all this neighborhood is just the same way.\" Which is definitely not true. So I think my experience is just, I believe although it should be within, I guess, the authority of the City of Boston in general to help. But it could also be people just volunteering and getting together from different neighborhoods, to actually build the community together and make a better Boston for themselves. Not just by just hoping that it'll become better somehow.

A little bit of what was mentioned earlier about affordability, but for me personally, being more trying to figure out what the best word would be, but I guess accessibility in essence. And in particular with young families. So you have the Lead laws for housing, and we were ghosted by realtor brokers and homeowners when we were looking for places to live here in Boston. Because we have a toddler, and we'll have another toddler in our home shortly. And they don't want to rent to us because of the Lead law compliance, which is not fair renting practices. So it makes it very difficult to think of a future here in Boston, when you're dealing with a housing situation on a lease by lease basis, and not sure if you'll even be allowed, from the sense of a realtor or a homeowner, to even begin to look for places here in Boston.

That's just been a really harsh experience we've had here in Boston several times, so it comes to our mind quickly.

So in particular, I guess this relates to my experience, I'm a stay-at-home mom with a two year old. We have another child who is missing his arms, and other disabilities, coming to our family through adoption. And we spend most of our day at the parks, and most of the parks we go to that are in walking distance, he can't reach most of the stuff because he has to climb ropes, or poles, or things that his body just isn't able to do.

We have similar problems, depending on where we are and our background, there may be some differences, but I like the idea of thinking as a city. I think that's a very powerful idea.

I think what we probably need is some hope, a breath of fresh air. One of the things someone comment on, is the voting and everyone concentrate on the presidential vote. I think, I'm not speaking for him, but I think in my mind, when Obama was running, we were hopeful. \"Wow, things are getting better.\" And I think that's what we need in our community right here in Boston.

And how can we provide resources for them to work through that? So for me, I'm really just thinking about, how can we create safe spaces for young people, teenagers, middle schoolers, high schoolers, to talk about what they're going through and then to get the help they need to deal with whatever it is that they're going through?

I've been working in one regard, the other with young people for the last 10 years and just doing life with them, spending time with them, mentoring, hanging out, just seeing this consistent theme of young people, especially brown and black young people, not feeling like they have anywhere to go when stuff is going wrong around them. And when they're facing a trial or something, or trauma or whatever it may be. So many times it's either they turn to their peers or they're keeping it in, or unfortunately, turn into other things to try and fill that void. And so I spent a lot of time working with young people in the context of the church. And so, a lot of it is spiritual-based, but as I grew older, I just really felt this need of, \"We can do more for these young people, than have them for two hours at a church service on a Friday night.\" "}, {"id": 15290000076, "conversation": "1529", "convo_index": "00076", "speaker": "David", "collection": "114", "convo_prop_index": "0.4", "words": "And so for me, it was just very looking for, \"How do I find a holistic way to be of service to young people, to see them get access to more than just mental health resources, but healthier food, education?\" And even this past summer, I encountered so many kids who just legitimately so intelligent, so smart. Even more than me, but [inaudible] for them, they don't want to go to school, they don't want to take classes, but it's so... Just tension of seeing the brilliance in them, that the things that they're passionate about, they're so gifted in, but then just having no desire to apply to the certain areas in school, or you even just like... Sometimes high school is just the end.

Especially in 2021, there are so many different ways that you can find success and make money and be happy and achieve all those goals.

So I'm really taking, just for me, just this idea of being more open to connections and not limiting it to... Obviously, I feel super comfortable with people my age, or obviously teenagers, because that's who I work with. But just being open to connections across all backgrounds, all ages, just really looking for that very just holistic connection with whoever comes into my life and whoever I interact with, in my community.

We set up these conversations around the city of Boston, for what we're calling Real Talk for Change, Boston. The idea here was to create an opportunity for people throughout Boston to actually have their voices heard. We targeted mostly what we call under heard voices. The people who in the midst of an election or other efforts in the city, don't necessarily get listened to, or don't have a platform that's really comfortable for them for saying what they want to say. Aren't, even if they do have [inaudible], there's no way to kind of get it in front of other people and people who should be listening to it.

Then with a team of people from our lab and a couple of key fellows, going through all those conversations and really finding the different things and highlights, that have come across in the conversations, and the patterns that are existing. Then pushing those back out to the public, to news media and others to actually try to elevate and give lift to those voices. Tonight, we're going to be recording. I want to say a couple things about the recording. This is an audio recording only. When we finish, this will actually... I'll take this back and upload it on the web.

We say living, shouldn't do that, but they are living on local network. We're doing Real Talk as our conversations, there are hundreds of other conversations going around the country in different formats and different things, we can all reside in the same place together.

What I want you to do is say your name, say what part of the city you're from, and then I'm going to give you some prompts. There's four prompts I'm going to ask you to check in on, okay?

So let me give you the instructions. What I want you to do is think about this a lot. The first part, and the first question I want you to respond to is this problem.

A family of three might spend like $3,000 to live in a luxury condo, and these luxury condos don't even have a living room. Traditionally, this neighborhood has been very... It has been working class young people of different color. But it seems like this in my experience with that is, it doesn't seem like these people are the ones being considered for these condos.

Boston, how do you make this a place that I can enjoy playing, meaning going out, enjoying the place to go and have fun with families and others and friends?

I guess my question for Boston is, what will it take to love Black people, the way rich White people love themselves? My experience as somebody that's been racialized White in this city, is that 450 years of White supremacy, bullshit lies, and the academy, and the fact that Judge Garrity in 1973, ordered 408 remedies for the school district to fix stuff for Black and Latino kids.

They had a shared agenda of empowering all of us, so that we could all live in a beautiful city. So that our kids...

We invited you to think about the pressing questions that you face, and we all face, but really you face here in Boston. Our goal today is to look at those questions and add your experience to, probably now, 300 other people who've had little conversations like this. We actually had two of these at Dorchester Bay. Elias was one of them. I'm going to begin recording, and I want to share a little information about why we're doing this. We're trying to create a new dialogue across the whole city of Boston, so people can really listen to each other. A lot of times people don't listen as well as they talk.

And also, a lot of trucks go through East Boston to different neighborhood areas like Chelsea Revere because of industrial reasons and purposes.

Allow others to speak for themselves, share the time and allow others to finish speaking, we take turns. I say we, but I will not be a part of this, I'm just a facilitator. State curious, ask honest questions. Pause, take time for reflections. Six, listen generously. Assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact.

And again, for me to get to him, even though it's not that far distance-wise, was an hour 75 minute, sometimes 90 minute trip taking the trains. Which is, that's not even me taking the bus. And he lives close to the train station and I live literally across the street from the train station. And so, since that time, I've gotten very into biking and it makes it a lot easier for me to take direct routes, and I can cut through Brooklyn now that I know the roads, and I can cut through Dorchester a little bit. But the roads there aren't really designed to bike well.

People talk about Boston having a dead night life and not having activities or not having things going on, and partially that's because the train shut down early, but also it's because it does feel like the city only recognizes the activities that are happening in the downtown area. The businesses that are happening in the downtown area, and the different neighborhoods that exist in the city of Boston don't necessarily get reflection or promotion or credit from the city of Boston unless it's outstanding to a different level. Yeah, I think that some of that is structural in how the trains and buses and things move always, like you said, funneling towards the center. But some of it also is marketing and space giving, where they're only highlighting the things that happen there, which is why everyone's attraction and attention goes there when they could diversify and split where they show.

I was doing some organizing work prior to COVID and some during it, but it felt really, very highly during COVID where people left to go home a lot. And because a lot of the young people in this organizing group, it wasn't just for students, but a lot of people were students, and it felt like discontinuous, kind of disjointed as people leave. And it's not really conducive to building long relationships, especially with people or groups who are based in Boston with people who've lived in Boston for a very long time and will continue to. And so it felt like, where is our place and can we really form partnerships with groups if the people in this organization are just going to keep cycling out every two or four years from school?

So I guess I'm just concerned about, in terms of why this resonated with me, I feel like I don't really hear about it from, specifically MIT in terms of climate resiliency. I never really hear about anything that it's trying to do or how it's collaborating with the city of Cambridge or anything like that. I really only hear about that from student groups and activists, but I never hear about it from the people who have the funds and the actual institutional power to provide resiliency.

So I think, I don't know. It stresses me out because it feels like there's nothing... I know so many people that are very invested in this at the school, and also hear about it from groups in Cambridge, but in terms of the people who can do things about it and have the power to set these large scale policies, I feel like I don't really hear about it, and it worries me.

So if you go all over the world, the Maldives is the first place to go. And so people, they waiting for the first sign. Let's see what's going to happen in Maldives. I'm talking about sea, the horizon. But the flooding is another issue.

Cambridge and Boston especially, and what's happening in the seaport, and invest a lot of money, and it's the most risky place to build. But when we coming to explain it as, we're getting money out of this, it's okay, because the developers were saying, we don't care.
