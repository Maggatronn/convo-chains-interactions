They don't eat dinner with each other. I think the pandemic has caused us to kind of stop and look and see that we do need each other.

It's affordable. It relies on its influencers and leaders to make those connections to those people who don't have the connections to information, and then as... What is your name again? I'm sorry.

Cortico is not going to own it. Community-based organizations are going to own it.

These issues of skills with teachers and certain restrictions that happen. And so yeah, how do we move sort of beyond that is the question. And my experience is, in high school, I was in a Mass experimental school system and we had this system called the model high. And it was part of, like they had a lower school, middle and upper. And one of the things about it was that a lot of the young people that went, they went because they were either kicked out or had difficulty either learn differently or whatever in the traditional school system.

So we was filled with kids who had behavioral issues, or had some difficulty in a lot of ways in dealing with the typical system. And so that was one reason why I think that it never got on track because of the results.

So I can see firsthand of how home culture can get confused with school culture and the school culture is totally different and teachers are doing the best that they can, but there will never be a connection without that home culture. So that's where they misunderstand and misinterpret our children's signs. Somebody might see my son as aggressive, but it's probably passionate or a cry for, \"I don't understand.\" When you have teaching tools or you're trying to say, \"Okay, well, this kid needs to learn social, emotional growth and tools to voice what the issue is that all school year, you say, \"It's okay, you can be mad.

So it's to be able to see that and to go through some experiences as a mom of a black child with another teacher and see like whole, it's like, yeah, educational system use my languages like that because of the world spent, the teachers not talking to the parents and the parents are afraid of the teachers and the teachers are afraid of parents, but nobody is willing to tell them that.

And so what I picked up from everybody just speaks to that. So nothing we do should be just self-centered. It really should be about the hood of our brothers and sisters.

Unless we have some type of resources for our young black men or men in general, it's not going to get done. So I really resonated with Akeya.

What I wanted to say the question that resonated with me is ironically yours, Fran, because I grew up in Mission Hill during the busing era. I moved here after living in Grove Hall and I came to shell shock because over there I had Black neighbors like myself and then I came here and it was primarily white. My first experience was going up to the playground in Mission Hill and having a white kid punched me in the face, no reason at all. And then our first encounter was my sister having to beat him up. And then in the fall, turns out that he's in my class. And so this is the beginning of my life as a middle schooler, listening to the stories of the high school and them having race wars and us fighting with our friends who were friends in school but as soon as we crossed the street from the Catholic middle school that we went to, then it was all hell that broke out.

So the systemic racism that exists now as the community and cultural engagement manager at Mass General hospital, I'm doing my best to break down a lot of those walls and having to fight with white people to get them to see why this is not a handout or a hand up, but it's just telling them that they as a system need to give back to a community that they've turned their back on for so many years.

We were all Black from the west side of Washington and the only way to get to Boston Bowl was walk. And we got jumped on our way coming back from bowling and car of young white men, young white boys jumped out and started to swing at us with golf clubs. I remember getting hit at my chest and the club breaking off. And ironically, how we got out of that, a vehicle stopped with an interracial couple.

With mental health, we don't really see it as a job issue, but it really is because when lives are stable and incomes are comparable to the national average, lives are better and the stress is less and you don't look for self-medication and you treat your kids better. So the quality of life all the way around where all of these things seem seemingly not connected are very interwoven like a sweater.

Well, actually my phone had broke and then I had lost it. It was raining really bad that day. And I went into crisis and I was looking for a phone to use. I was near a friend's house.

Can I use your phone?\" And they was like, \"Oh, my phone's off. I'm going to go pay my bill now.\" So I was going to go with them to pay their bill. So I asked, \"Can I just walk with you or whatever?\" And they act like they didn't know me. So that led me to go to wait for them at their house.

It was more than one person attacking me. Someone called the ambulance because I was obviously beaten up and I had to go to Boston Medical and mind you, I still had no phone. And my family started worrying about me. They had to put a missing persons report because remember I had no phone, I wasn't home. And I was never able to use someone else's phone.

Well thank you for inviting me, Ms. Fran. We have family day. When was it, last Thursday? Last Thursday. And we had Mr. Brian Warren, he's running for Boston city council district four. So I told him that we got to have a whole bunch of conversations about what needs to change and we're going to be talking about him in these meetings. So I just wanted to bring that back to you guys. And he didn't really turn into a politician after that, but he was cool guy. Shot some basketball in the community, and it was good to see him out. Him and one other lady was out there. I can't think of her name right now. But they was out there and we had a lot of people out there.

Also, for myself when I lived in Boston, I had to move every two years and I had trouble finding single apartment living for myself as an individual, whereas living in a studio was about the same amount of market rent for someone who had a three bedroom. So when I was paying 1200 for a studio, someone could pay 1200 and get a three bedroom.

I had a one bedroom apartment for $600. This is back in 1990, 1991 in that state and that was market rent. It was over at 420 Mass Avenue right next to the train station.

I try to do some research on re-entry in prison and see what's out there and there's places that do stuff but, like George was saying, it's half ended. They have all these good intentions. They give us all these hopeful resources, but access to these resources and the practice of these resources once we have access to there's disconnect.

And when I can remember coming up where I needed some help and there was no cultural competence, so there were no doctors or therapists that looked like me that I was dealing with. So there was a disconnect. And now all these years later where that's been addressed in some ways there aren't a lot of people doing the work that lived like me. And what I'm hearing from this group is that there are some common themes.

We need the Mayor to come out here, talk to the residents and so the residents can tell them... because I don't think kids are really bad, they grow onto us. Because we got some kids in here, and they were good kids, but they started smoking dope, and now they come running across the field, they getting shot at. Those are the kids that were in here with us, and they were little kids. And now they grow up to be 14 and 15, they're only 14 and 15, they're still little kids. They have to cross the field and somebody is shooting at them. And this happened this summer.

Where are the conversations that are being had to know that everything is interconnected?

I felt like they were the last two stopgaps, to really kind of say, \"Everybody's not being included, especially Black folks.\" So when I see everything moving up, and you're seeing the new buildings and new development in the city, I see the conspiracy unfold where home ownership looks like the MCAT scores for schools, where certain folks, usually Chinese folks and White folks score way above Latinos and Blacks, and other folks. So I think that ties into home ownership, how much you make to survive in the city. That's usually not minority folks that are doing good on the MCAT scores, or will be inclusive into home buying in the city.

And to support those goals, we will introduce a few guidelines for our conversation. One, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, allow others to speak for themselves. Three, share time, allow others to finish speaking, take turns, stay courteous, ask honest questions, pause, take time for reflection, listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. When possible, close unnecessary program applications and notifications. That means you all's phones go on silent. If you need to take a moment to take a break, let the facilitator know.

Our goal today is to share and elaborate on those questions and engage in a conversation with each other.

We want to create a new space across the city to facilitate more constructive listening across divides, neighborhood, political, and cultural, et cetera. And provide improved visibility and accountability between the candidates and the future mayor and neighborhoods throughout the city. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. These conversations are focused on sharing personal stories from your lived experience, rather than entering the conversation with your positions on the upcoming election or specific candidates.

I was excited to see, what, two Black... three Black people in the race, people of color, and to see the results where none of them actually made it beyond the primaries. My question is like, well, will Boston ever have a Black mayor? Are they even ready for a Black mayor? I say that with the full understanding of they had their...

I mean commissioner, excuse me. But basically had Blacks in every level of law enforcement at the highest level. I don't know. And I'm thinking like, will Boston ever have a Black mayor? That's why I checked in like intellectual. Because to me, that's something... I think this was the best chance ever to have a Black man and it never happened. I know that I've been in Massachusetts a long time and I've known somebody become the mayor, they're there till they die, they leave, or they go somewhere else.

And so it takes me to a place where I say, as a woman of color, what could I have possibly done to maybe help to get some of those candidates over the top? I ask myself that question actually a lot. Because when I think of about it, it's somewhat hurtful. Do I think that we will ever be at a place where we could be so close now? I know that the two candidates that are in the running are considered women of color. I understand. From my perspective, as a Black woman, when I hear woman of color, I only hear Black. Black is women of color. I know that women of color can be... I'm pretty educated, I understand that. But so, yeah, I'm just a little confused a little bit. I'll get through it. But what do these folks have to offer to the community that I service? I didn't see any of them in my neighborhood of town. So it's interesting.

Being someone who... education was significantly affected by COVID, my undergrad year ended with COVID and then my post-grad year started with COVID as well. So I do think a lot of great things have been done to sort of make up for the in-person. However, I do think nothing's going to go back to the way it was before, and I'm curious to see how we move forward from here. While I can't relate to this directly, I've had a lot of exposure to exactly what Edee was talking about in terms of people coming out of prison and jail, and thinking that some of the same limits that they experienced in these institutions are the same limits that they had in the outside world. And that's just something that we have all been working towards as a group, especially here, towards changing. And it just opened my eyes to the fact that we need to do it... or I need to do it, even more so beyond this scope. And that's something that I want to do moving forward.

I mean, where we can express ourselves fully and not be worried about getting food on the table and at whatever, whether you're fortunate enough to be, gainfully employed, have a career or wherever you are on the various spectrums of life, to feel whole and to have a rich spiritual and community life.

So the conversation agreement is speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, allow others to speak for themselves, share the time, allow others to finish speaking and take turns, stay curious, ask honest questions, pause, take time for reflection, listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact, when possible close unnecessary programs, applications and notifications, and put your phone on silent or vibrate.

And I feel in some respects, it has become an almost out of sight out of mind, even though it's not out of sight because it is literally in the street. It is in the McDonald's bathroom folks shooting up. It is on the highway. It is on Southampton. It's on Topeka. You see the tents.

And the experience that made me to think about that is actually the fact that every day I have to drive for over an hour and a half, each way in order for me to be able to commute to my workplace or to drop off my son at school, which it made me think about that every day.

They will not be able to afford rent, houses. Because again, Massachusetts' population is going so fast and the rent is crazy high. The reason why I think about that because myself, so I've been looking to buy a house, almost for a year. I haven't been able to find one because it's crazy, they have too much demand and they don't have too many offers. Are they have any plans in place?

So Ceasar, if you can just do us a favor and drop those names in the chat, so we have a list follow, if that is okay. Thank you, Ceasar. So Yomaira you're first.

Because I think it gives us an opportunity not just to express, but become a better idea and how we feel identify ourselves with everything that is going on, and be a little be empathetic with if somebody gets late to work or to school, understand that probably ran late on traffic.

So my question was basically, will there be more events held between different neighborhoods? Could be focused for example, on volunteering, and basically more educational realm that would help, for example, underrepresented neighborhoods. And I guess the experience I had coming to Boston, for example for college, when I came in 2016 to Northeastern, I always heard about the different neighborhoods within the area. But everyone is just like, \"Oh, go to this neighborhood, then go to that neighborhood.\" And I think people don't think like why different neighborhoods are different. And I one of the things we always noticed, is just differences in education, differences in support system within each community. And I think like all these things make me think of how each community, with more help or with more funding, can be helped more. And have, for example, more safety within Boston.

So I think my experience is just, I believe although it should be within, I guess, the authority of the City of Boston in general to help. But it could also be people just volunteering and getting together from different neighborhoods, to actually build the community together and make a better Boston for themselves.

A little bit of what was mentioned earlier about affordability, but for me personally, being more trying to figure out what the best word would be, but I guess accessibility in essence. And in particular with young families. So you have the Lead laws for housing, and we were ghosted by realtor brokers and homeowners when we were looking for places to live here in Boston. Because we have a toddler, and we'll have another toddler in our home shortly. And they don't want to rent to us because of the Lead law compliance, which is not fair renting practices. So it makes it very difficult to think of a future here in Boston, when you're dealing with a housing situation on a lease by lease basis, and not sure if you'll even be allowed, from the sense of a realtor or a homeowner, to even begin to look for places here in Boston.

Thank, you for sharing, Alveta. That was some really powerful stuff. I think what led me to my question... I've been working in one regard, the other with young people for the last 10 years and just doing life with them, spending time with them, mentoring, hanging out, just seeing this consistent theme of young people, especially brown and black young people, not feeling like they have anywhere to go when stuff is going wrong around them. And when they're facing a trial or something, or trauma or whatever it may be. So many times it's either they turn to their peers or they're keeping it in, or unfortunately, turn into other things to try and fill that void. And so I spent a lot of time working with young people in the context of the church. And so, a lot of it is spiritual-based, but as I grew older, I just really felt this need of, \"We can do more for these young people, than have them for two hours at a church service on a Friday night.\" "}, {"id": 15290000076, "conversation": "1529", "convo_index": "00076", "rootx": 1173.8251779593675, "rooty": 246.29442551556755, "kmeans": 7, "speaker": "David", "collection": "114", "convo_prop_index": 0.48717948717948717, "words": "And so for me, it was just very looking for, \"How do I find a holistic way to be of service to young people, to see them get access to more than just mental health resources, but healthier food, education?\" And even this past summer, I encountered so many kids who just legitimately so intelligent, so smart. Even more than me, but [inaudible] for them, they don't want to go to school, they don't want to take classes, but it's so...

Oh, I'd say, one was probably about five years old, 10 years old. And one that was 12, 13.

People coming and going, people moving in, moving out. No longer family homes, family dwellings from generation to the next. But I think as I was listening to Gail, the thing that comes to mind for me is that it's like not having an infrastructure. It's like not building an infrastructure, so that everybody who comes in, they come into something new.

But imagine that if we were in that time, when we actually made it a point to get to know people so that your street has an identity, your street has a culture. So that as people are coming in, it's not a chore to convince people to come to neighborhood association meetings, because the first time they see it or hear about it is not when you are shoving a notice in their mailbox, it's because you've actually had a conversation with them and you've mentioned it to them, you've told them about it.

As a child when the white boys, white girls busting our windows out I'm looking out the window peeking. And we'd call the cops. They'd come, do nothing, absolutely nothing. So as a little girl watching this, my mom walking around the house with a football helmet because bricks was coming through the windows. It got so back the Black Panthers actually came to Maverick projects to help us, to assist us because the cops never ever did anything for us. So my whole life I've endured this kind of racism on the police force, as a parent living in the projects in South Street watching my son and his friends being harassed constantly by the police.

There's a lot of walks and different things for breast cancer and different things like that, but there's no things that minorities know about or feel comfortable participating in.

What I understood was, that was the white power structure that went behind some curtain like the Wizard of Oz and made everything happen bad for working class people, especially Black, Latino, immigrants, women, people who live in public housing and depend on the safety network from a federal government that has shrunk considerably in the 21st century. I guess my question for Boston is, what will it take to love Black people, the way rich White people love themselves? My experience as somebody that's been racialized White in this city, is that 450 years of White supremacy, bullshit lies, and the academy, and the fact that Judge Garrity in 1973, ordered 408 remedies for the school district to fix stuff for Black and Latino kids.

They had a shared agenda of empowering all of us, so that we could all live in a beautiful city. So that our kids...

So I moved to Boston four years ago, and I moved into Austin Brighton because that's where the internet said to move to and I forgot the internet is white. And a lot of the Black neighborhoods in Boston, they weren't even that far from me, but because Brookline juts in through Boston, there's very little transportation that goes through Brookline to get between where I live in Austin, Brighton to Dorchester and Mattapan and Roxbury and other Black communities in Boston.

And again, for me to get to him, even though it's not that far distance-wise, was an hour 75 minute, sometimes 90 minute trip taking the trains. Which is, that's not even me taking the bus. And he lives close to the train station and I live literally across the street from the train station.

People talk about Boston having a dead night life and not having activities or not having things going on, and partially that's because the train shut down early, but also it's because it does feel like the city only recognizes the activities that are happening in the downtown area. The businesses that are happening in the downtown area, and the different neighborhoods that exist in the city of Boston don't necessarily get reflection or promotion or credit from the city of Boston unless it's outstanding to a different level. Yeah, I think that some of that is structural in how the trains and buses and things move always, like you said, funneling towards the center.

And that's not hyperbole, I really think it's important that there could be a young person, younger than you all that says, \"I want to talk about climate change but nobody else is.\" And then they somehow stumble into Real Talk for Change and find out, \"Well my near peers, college students are talking about it. So maybe there is a way for me to enter this.\" And that's it for me. Is there any other thoughts about, before we close this out, what you might have been hearing or did hear in other people's experiences as you entered into this conversation?

I'm not pessimistic, but the reality of, we have to start or at least stop thinking of saving ourself alone on this planet going to be the key.
