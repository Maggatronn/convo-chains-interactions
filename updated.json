And that you understand that the conversation will be part of a collection of Cortico's Living Voices Network whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another.

Cortico is not going to own it. Community-based organizations are going to own it. And if you decide at any time you want to not be on the system anymore or something like that, you can turn to a community-based organization who can help make that happen.

I'm going to ask you to respond to those prompts only and at one point we'll have a much more fluid and open flow. One of the things that's really important about this conversation is, we ask you to speak only for yourself. Everything in this conversation is about grounding in your own experience.

So the experience I'm thinking of is a small community based nonprofit that I work with that was given a legislative earmark from a state agency. So we went to meet with the person to get it. It's like 50,000 bucks. It was like really good for the small organization.

These issues of skills with teachers and certain restrictions that happen. And so yeah, how do we move sort of beyond that is the question. And my experience is, in high school, I was in a Mass experimental school system and we had this system called the model high. And it was part of, like they had a lower school, middle and upper. And one of the things about it was that a lot of the young people that went, they went because they were either kicked out or had difficulty either learn differently or whatever in the traditional school system."}, {"id": 13800058, "conversation": 1380, "convo_index": 58, "rootx": 514.6872993648856, "rooty": 427.8294279925714, "convo_prop_index": 0.5370370370370371, "speaker": "James", "words": "And so as an experiment, I thought that this is a skewed experiment because what you're doing is that you're loading the experimental school.

So we was filled with kids who had behavioral issues, or had some difficulty in a lot of ways in dealing with the typical system. And so that was one reason why I think that it never got on track because of the results.

I have a knack of bringing up people from an international concert to a local concert.

But I also watched even through the city of Boston, in Codman Square, people that were in wheelchairs and before they started looking at the ADA compliance sidewalks, it was difficult.

So I can see firsthand of how home culture can get confused with school culture and the school culture is totally different and teachers are doing the best that they can, but there will never be a connection without that home culture. So that's where they misunderstand and misinterpret our children's signs. Somebody might see my son as aggressive, but it's probably passionate or a cry for, \"I don't understand.\" When you have teaching tools or you're trying to say, \"Okay, well, this kid needs to learn social, emotional growth and tools to voice what the issue is that all school year, you say, \"It's okay, you can be mad.

So it's to be able to see that and to go through some experiences as a mom of a black child with another teacher and see like whole, it's like, yeah, educational system use my languages like that because of the world spent, the teachers not talking to the parents and the parents are afraid of the teachers and the teachers are afraid of parents, but nobody is willing to tell them that.

I don't know how to like put it. So it's like, might've been these policies, like who makes these policies? Because I don't live in public housing. So public housing is a lot easier to pick up the phone and say, \"Hey, I think I have been racially discriminated,\" and they'll do something about it quicker, the private low-income housing.

Like he would be the mechanic guy doing that. And then also, financially I had so little money. I had a student loan, but there were barriers to like getting the money. And there was a period of time where I had like a week where I couldn't buy groceries. So I was like hungry.

Because that was my issue back then when I did have an issue with the MBTA is that, if the bus was late and then crowded on top of that, it would just pass us by.

I've buried more young people, not now because now I'm older, but 35 to fifties, there was so many people dying all the time. And I actually did an experiment with a friend of mine. We tried to score a bag of reefer or a gun on a Saturday night in the nineties, he was a Black man, I was a white woman. We couldn't find pot, but we found guns easily.

What I wanted to say the question that resonated with me is ironically yours, Fran, because I grew up in Mission Hill during the busing era. I moved here after living in Grove Hall and I came to shell shock because over there I had Black neighbors like myself and then I came here and it was primarily white. My first experience was going up to the playground in Mission Hill and having a white kid punched me in the face, no reason at all. And then our first encounter was my sister having to beat him up. And then in the fall, turns out that he's in my class. And so this is the beginning of my life as a middle schooler, listening to the stories of the high school and them having race wars and us fighting with our friends who were friends in school but as soon as we crossed the street from the Catholic middle school that we went to, then it was all hell that broke out."}, {"id": 14120086, "conversation": 1412, "convo_index": 86, "rootx": 509.4734672366412, "rooty": 463.47162682628567, "convo_prop_index": 0.6991869918699187, "speaker": "Cindy", "words": "And so I became an activist when I was 14, very young.

And so I think that probably about three or four years ago, I joined the board of our neighborhood bus but before that, I still had a lot of that animosity. So the systemic racism that exists now as the community and cultural engagement manager at Mass General hospital, I'm doing my best to break down a lot of those walls and having to fight with white people to get them to see why this is not a handout or a hand up, but it's just telling them that they as a system need to give back to a community that they've turned their back on for so many years."}, {"id": 14120089, "conversation": 1412, "convo_index": 89, "rootx": 571.4683183267176, "rooty": 453.33020373685713, "convo_prop_index": 0.7235772357723578, "speaker": "Norma", "words": "Okay.

We were all Black from the west side of Washington and the only way to get to Boston Bowl was walk. And we got jumped on our way coming back from bowling and car of young white men, young white boys jumped out and started to swing at us with golf clubs. I remember getting hit at my chest and the club breaking off. And ironically, how we got out of that, a vehicle stopped with an interracial couple.

They really overlap with a lot of the different things that we are concerned about at this table right now. And if we can see the connection, you can see how important it is to act today. With mental health, we don't really see it as a job issue, but it really is because when lives are stable and incomes are comparable to the national average, lives are better and the stress is less and you don't look for self-medication and you treat your kids better. So the quality of life all the way around where all of these things seem seemingly not connected are very interwoven like a sweater.

Well, actually my phone had broke and then I had lost it. It was raining really bad that day. And I went into crisis and I was looking for a phone to use. I was near a friend's house.

Can I use your phone?\" And they was like, \"Oh, my phone's off. I'm going to go pay my bill now.\" So I was going to go with them to pay their bill. So I asked, \"Can I just walk with you or whatever?\" And they act like they didn't know me. So that led me to go to wait for them at their house.

I'm a friend of your neighbors.\" And I've seen them before and they've seen me before and they just started attacking. So you can imagine how strange that was. It was a very serious altercation. It was more than one person attacking me. Someone called the ambulance because I was obviously beaten up and I had to go to Boston Medical and mind you, I still had no phone. And my family started worrying about me. They had to put a missing persons report because remember I had no phone, I wasn't home. And I was never able to use someone else's phone. And it bothered me that when somebody could be needing help or something and they knock on your door and the first thing you do is attack them, you don't try to give, you know what I mean, help them out and see if there's anything, if they need to use a phone or if you could show them where the ... just help out instead of ... like, the first instinct was for these people to attack me.

And then you see all the violence that happened within the police force and you can see how racism has infiltrated law enforcement.

Also, for myself when I lived in Boston, I had to move every two years and I had trouble finding single apartment living for myself as an individual, whereas living in a studio was about the same amount of market rent for someone who had a three bedroom. So when I was paying 1200 for a studio, someone could pay 1200 and get a three bedroom.

I had a one bedroom apartment for $600. This is back in 1990, 1991 in that state and that was market rent. It was over at 420 Mass Avenue right next to the train station.

They give us all these hopeful resources, but access to these resources and the practice of these resources once we have access to there's disconnect.

So there was a disconnect. And now all these years later where that's been addressed in some ways there aren't a lot of people doing the work that lived like me.

Because a developer bought my unit and they kicked us all out. So I couldn't afford to stay in East Boston.

They quickly know they have to pay a white business or a white person in that business, but for a black and brown, they wonder is it really cheap or a free service. And it's a challenge and it's very frustrating, because I have probably developed a strong network in my time in Boston and a lot of people want to tap into that network, but they don't want to pay.

Prior to losing my son, if anyone had asked me if Dorchester was a safe place, I probably would have said I felt safe because I wasn't aware of what was going on. But after losing my son, I was exposed to so many younger people and they would share with me what their world is like and I didn't know we lived in two different worlds. Their worlds are way different than our worlds and they do collide because as an adult, you could be walking down the street or simply driving your car and you could get killed and that's scary to think that you could sit on your porch and get killed on your porch like that woman that was up in Upham's Corner, she was an elderly person, I think in her 80s or something, just minding her business on her porch and she was taken, she was stolen."}, {"id": 14460089, "conversation": 1446, "convo_index": 89, "rootx": 516.7462822137406, "rooty": 418.88354669228573, "convo_prop_index": 0.4472361809045226, "speaker": "Keemy", "words": "And so was my son, my son was stolen.

There weren't fireworks, gunshots, whatever going off all the times of the day and night. There was a certain peace about where you lived.

And someone said to me recently that they have discovered that a whole lot of young people seem to be suffering from some aspect of mental illness, that there's a lot of depression, a lot of anxiety, a lot of young people experiencing panic attacks and so on. It has become, and these are not my words, but someone said to me recently, it has become almost epidemic now. So I believe that it's something that needs attention.

But I think that whoever made the decision could have done a better job in finding the routes that they needed to to amend with these bicycles.

One woman told me in order to get around the corner to a store that she frequented in the past, now it takes two times, three times as long to get there because now there's only one lane versus two that were available in the past.

Where are the conversations that are being had to know that everything is interconnected? So if you want us to be able to access the generational wealth, typically, in order for us to access it, we need to get a loan in order for us to make that purchase.

It's just taking your money and then not investing into any of the programming around you. And investing in anything that's beneficial for you.

I felt like they were the last two stopgaps, to really kind of say, \"Everybody's not being included, especially Black folks.\" So when I see everything moving up, and you're seeing the new buildings and new development in the city, I see the conspiracy unfold where home ownership looks like the MCAT scores for schools, where certain folks, usually Chinese folks and White folks score way above Latinos and Blacks, and other folks.

Why do I arrive at that question? Because I've moved about 18 times, I'm not a homeowner, and rents are beyond...

My question about the future of Boston and my place in this future is... I mean, my question is centered around the results of the primary of the election. I voted in the election. I was happy to vote in the primary. I even took some first time voters to the polls. I was excited to see, what, two Black... three Black people in the race, people of color, and to see the results where none of them actually made it beyond the primaries. My question is like, well, will Boston ever have a Black mayor? Are they even ready for a Black mayor? I say that with the full understanding of they had their... Massachusetts had the first Black senator ever elected, the second Black governor ever elected."}, {"id": 14830043, "conversation": 1483, "convo_index": 43, "rootx": 496.3320353557253, "rooty": 466.167568752, "convo_prop_index": 0.3282442748091603, "speaker": "Armand", "words": "And during this time where the plight of people of color are elevated and they had three strong candidates on the ballot, none of them made it through. To me, that felt like... that was a blow. I was like, that was crazy to me. I couldn't even fathom that, especially when I looked at around, at one point in time, I think last year, maybe even this year, Boston had a Black district attorney, Black sheriff, Black chief... I mean commissioner, excuse me. But basically had Blacks in every level of law enforcement at the highest level. I don't know. And I'm thinking like, will Boston ever have a Black mayor? That's why I checked in like intellectual. Because to me, that's something... I think this was the best chance ever to have a Black man and it never happened. I know that I've been in Massachusetts a long time and I've known somebody become the mayor, they're there till they die, they leave, or they go somewhere else. This was a once in lifetime chance, I think. And I'm just kind of like, I don't know. For me, I think that plays into my experience as well. So that's my question, you know?

As a matter of fact, even talking about it now, my heart is really heavy. And so it takes me to a place where I say, as a woman of color, what could I have possibly done to maybe help to get some of those candidates over the top? I ask myself that question actually a lot. Because when I think of about it, it's somewhat hurtful. Do I think that we will ever be at a place where we could be so close now? I know that the two candidates that are in the running are considered women of color. I understand. From my perspective, as a Black woman, when I hear woman of color, I only hear Black. Black is women of color. I know that women of color can be... I'm pretty educated, I understand that. But so, yeah, I'm just a little confused a little bit. I'll get through it. But what do these folks have to offer to the community that I service? I didn't see any of them in my neighborhood of town. So it's interesting. And for someone who works for the state, it's even more interesting to me.

But I feel sort of naive or ignorant in a way, because I didn't know much about the election and I didn't know much about the candidates. And I think that's the problem. So my question is, will there ever be any future initiative directed at young people living in the city, on this topic especially? Because even though I can't necessarily vote right now, whatever the outcome is of this election, or regardless, everything that's going on is still affecting me.

And now white people buying up all the property. Everybody but Blacks seem like they buying up stuff around mean and it's... And I don't know how that process could be reversed.

So there's lots of stuff that needs to be out there and people need to be educated if those are the votes that they really want. But maybe that kind of work is too hard. I don't know.

So I do think a lot of great things have been done to sort of make up for the in-person. However, I do think nothing's going to go back to the way it was before, and I'm curious to see how we move forward from here. While I can't relate to this directly, I've had a lot of exposure to exactly what Edee was talking about in terms of people coming out of prison and jail, and thinking that some of the same limits that they experienced in these institutions are the same limits that they had in the outside world. And that's just something that we have all been working towards as a group, especially here, towards changing.

We used to go into Lower Allston or even Little Italy or even North End, and those kind of areas, you don't really see any of these operators or even businesses in that area. So to say, there is a restriction between Boston and Natives and then coming back to Bruce's ideal is why can't we not all live in peace, but for understanding is the reason why we can't leave in peace because we live under different tax brackets."}, {"id": 14840091, "conversation": 1484, "convo_index": 91, "rootx": 471.6838967694657, "rooty": 449.5901437491428, "convo_prop_index": 0.5617283950617284, "speaker": "William", "words": "So as me, I'm a Roxbury native.

I wonder, is there a way that you could make a residency preference for people who have been born in Boston or lived in Boston so many years, like on the affordable housing.

I'm tired of the violence in the city. I'm just tired. And there's a lot of collective trauma in the city of Boston that needs healing, collectively. Boston is traumatic. So there's benefits, but there's a lot of traumas in our community and a lot of trauma in Boston. There's just healing that needs to happen."}, {"id": 149500113, "conversation": 1495, "convo_index": 113, "rootx": 512.8277218076337, "rooty": 474.74263082314286, "convo_prop_index": 0.9826086956521739, "speaker": "Charmaine", "words": "I said it to somebody the other day when they try to entertain this conversation even about politics and the outcome of the mayoral race.

But my question is... Or I don't know. How we can divest from police and put that money toward communities and into communities while upholding a feeling of safety for everyone. Yeah. And so my background in arriving at that question is I guess, my engagement in racial justice groups and more recently, organizations focused on prison abolition and de-carceration efforts, and more recently transformative justice work and just kind of thinking about alternatives to what is very harmful sort of police and prison reality that we are existing in.

Do we have any prison rights? Because there's been a lot of issues around that, and how do we approach this? How do we expose information? And let me just redirect to the point. South Bay, right up the street for me pretty much, 15 minute walk. Recently they've been protesting over there because there have been 14 deaths, serious. And it's just being exposed. There's a lot of things around that. 14 deaths and they want to shut down. People, family members are protesting every day because they're saying that their loved ones are not safe.

And I say that as someone who lives in Roxbury, not far from the, what's termed the mass and cast area, and it is appalling, how people are being treated and how we are treating residents of our city and our state down there. And I feel in some respects, it has become an almost out of sight out of mind, even though it's not out of sight because it is literally in the street. It is in the McDonald's bathroom folks shooting up. It is on the highway. It is on Southampton. It's on Topeka. You see the tents.

So we can not just say we're going to address climate change by having electric vehicles, because that does not solve the fundamental problem of how do we get away from our dependency upon cars and traffic density. So it's one of those things and particularly because we are a city at and below sea level, this is a real question, and it does become an environmental justice question too because different pockets and areas of our city environmentally are worse off now than other pockets.

Some places undesirable and then the place you were living in is too expensive. So then you go over here because it's a little less expensive, and then it becomes desirable. And so yes, there were certainly a lot of inclusion in terms of different groups being able to move in but it was also because it was affordable.

I haven't been able to find one because it's crazy, they have too much demand and they don't have too many offers. Are they have any plans in place?

So what Yomaira has said earlier about the traffic that I can touch on that because in EC where I live right now, they're building... Every month, it looks like they're just building something new. And the traffic here has gone up by a lot. A couple years ago, it might have been a little bit bad, but now it's pretty bad. Especially in the mornings, when a lot of people that bought all these new apartments here, they usually go work in the city. So the tunnels, it's crazy, man. It's jam packed in the morning. So I think they should figure out a way, I don't know, maybe make a new road or something to help the traffic in that area.

When you have all these people moving in and you're pumping so much money into one space, the rent is bound to go up. And then that leads to usually, people of color and minorities getting pushed out due to all these people moving in because now they're not able to pay on rent anymore.

So it's over 80% people of color. But there wasn't a lot of black males working there and there wasn't a lot of black females working there. And it's like, some of the teacher couldn't relate to.

So my question was basically, will there be more events held between different neighborhoods?

And I guess the experience I had coming to Boston, for example for college, when I came in 2016 to Northeastern, I always heard about the different neighborhoods within the area. But everyone is just like, \"Oh, go to this neighborhood, then go to that neighborhood.\" And I think people don't think like why different neighborhoods are different. And I one of the things we always noticed, is just differences in education, differences in support system within each community. And I think like all these things make me think of how each community, with more help or with more funding, can be helped more. And have, for example, more safety within Boston."}, {"id": 15030038, "conversation": 1503, "convo_index": 38, "rootx": 476.08927879694664, "rooty": 460.6451119002857, "convo_prop_index": 0.4318181818181818, "speaker": "Jason", "words": "And I think a lot of people have concerns about going to different neighborhoods, just because of what they think that neighborhood is, or what each neighborhood could be like. And especially coming from abroad, everyone's tells you not to go to a certain neighborhood within Boston, or they just say, \"Oh, all this neighborhood is just the same way.\" Which is definitely not true. So I think my experience is just, I believe although it should be within, I guess, the authority of the City of Boston in general to help. But it could also be people just volunteering and getting together from different neighborhoods, to actually build the community together and make a better Boston for themselves. Not just by just hoping that it'll become better somehow."}, {"id": 15030040, "conversation": 1503, "convo_index": 40, "rootx": 460.9516718900764, "rooty": 460.6176092965714, "convo_prop_index": 0.45454545454545453, "speaker": "Brad", "words": "So, how I thought of this was related to housing. A little bit of what was mentioned earlier about affordability, but for me personally, being more trying to figure out what the best word would be, but I guess accessibility in essence. And in particular with young families. So you have the Lead laws for housing, and we were ghosted by realtor brokers and homeowners when we were looking for places to live here in Boston. Because we have a toddler, and we'll have another toddler in our home shortly. And they don't want to rent to us because of the Lead law compliance, which is not fair renting practices. So it makes it very difficult to think of a future here in Boston, when you're dealing with a housing situation on a lease by lease basis, and not sure if you'll even be allowed, from the sense of a realtor or a homeowner, to even begin to look for places here in Boston.

That's just been a really harsh experience we've had here in Boston several times, so it comes to our mind quickly.

So in particular, I guess this relates to my experience, I'm a stay-at-home mom with a two year old. We have another child who is missing his arms, and other disabilities, coming to our family through adoption.

And I'm checking in, I feel maybe intellectually today, because like I said when I came on, I felt like this morning being The Indigenous People Day... And that's rather new, but not so new. There's been little talk some years back, but never amplified to the point where it is today. And so listening to some of the radio cast today, it was interesting to me to discover how many people really didn't know history. Not so much about Indigenous People Day, but about Christopher Columbus Day and what he actually was known for."}, {"id": 15290020, "conversation": 1529, "convo_index": 20, "rootx": 599.7524785618322, "rooty": 555.6590341842857, "convo_prop_index": 0.12903225806451613, "speaker": "Marilyn", "words": "So I thought, \"Well everybody knows that Christopher Columbus sailed the Ocean Blue in 1892.\" I thought that.

So we don't know where it's going. So, you think you're are getting a good deal when low and behold, it comes back and it becomes luxury property.

And how can we provide resources for them to work through that?

I can truthfully say to you now that I can't really walk out my front door and call anyone by name. My neighbor to my left has a lot of kids.

It's got to have Gail on the call, and I should be on the call and Marilyn should be there. We need Shemeka and David to be there, to bring that perspective that oftentimes is beyond us because we are not thinking along that vein anymore.

I've been working in one regard, the other with young people for the last 10 years and just doing life with them, spending time with them, mentoring, hanging out, just seeing this consistent theme of young people, especially brown and black young people, not feeling like they have anywhere to go when stuff is going wrong around them. And when they're facing a trial or something, or trauma or whatever it may be. So many times it's either they turn to their peers or they're keeping it in, or unfortunately, turn into other things to try and fill that void. And so I spent a lot of time working with young people in the context of the church.

Is that we all talked about community in one sense or another. And the thing about my community, my street, is that we went from families who had lived there for decades, to my street now being very transient. People coming and going, people moving in, moving out. No longer family homes, family dwellings from generation to the next. But I think as I was listening to Gail, the thing that comes to mind for me is that it's like not having an infrastructure. It's like not building an infrastructure, so that everybody who comes in, they come into something new. Imagine what it would be like if your community or your street is one that [inaudible] somebody new comes in, you realize they're new to the street."}, {"id": 152900125, "conversation": 1529, "convo_index": 125, "rootx": 492.3194288305345, "rooty": 468.2723824645714, "convo_prop_index": 0.8064516129032258, "speaker": "Alveta", "words": "You welcome them for being new to the street, as opposed to looking at them and saying, \"Okay, I wonder how long they going to be here.

But imagine that if we were in that time, when we actually made it a point to get to know people so that your street has an identity, your street has a culture. So that as people are coming in, it's not a chore to convince people to come to neighborhood association meetings, because the first time they see it or hear about it is not when you are shoving a notice in their mailbox, it's because you've actually had a conversation with them and you've mentioned it to them, you've told them about it."}, {"id": 152900126, "conversation": 1529, "convo_index": 126, "rootx": 490.35435378015273, "rooty": 473.2865990228572, "convo_prop_index": 0.8129032258064516, "speaker": "Alveta", "words": "So that when it happens, you can say, \"Oh, remember I told you about that meeting, would you like to come with me?\" And I think that we have moved so far...

And I'm just thinking that if we had something that even resembled that... Businesses and organizations survive when they have an infrastructure, right? When they have funds, when they have...

Obviously, I feel super comfortable with people my age, or obviously teenagers, because that's who I work with. But just being open to connections across all backgrounds, all ages, just really looking for that very just holistic connection with whoever comes into my life and whoever I interact with, in my community.

I guess my question for Boston is, what will it take to love Black people, the way rich White people love themselves?

There is no fence which can protect the passengers from falling to the subway, which I find is quite scary.

Well, the airport is our neighbor, so there's emissions from cars coming in and out of Logan airports, emissions from the planes. There are truck routes all around through East Boston. And also, a lot of trucks go through East Boston to different neighborhood areas like Chelsea Revere because of industrial reasons and purposes.

Because what I feel is one reason why they're going is because it's prominent in other developing countries as well. The income for the public servants are very low.

And so there were six units, I guess, in total. So I had five neighbors and I had interacted maybe once briefly with one of them.

The businesses that are happening in the downtown area, and the different neighborhoods that exist in the city of Boston don't necessarily get reflection or promotion or credit from the city of Boston unless it's outstanding to a different level.

But they seem very big, as an understatement, and a lot of our question about the city of Boston is for the entities or institutions that we exist in much bigger than us, how come we don't hear more from them in addressing these issues that are closer to their scale?"}, {"id": 28380097, "conversation": 2838, "convo_index": 97, "rootx": 496.2849376763359, "rooty": 475.62763105028574, "convo_prop_index": 0.9150943396226415, "speaker": "Gr3y", "words": "The organizations and institutions in the run.
