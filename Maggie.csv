Story of advocate.,"I've had six friends move away in the last year or two. When I first moved to Boston, there is a Facebook group for low income people. It's a place where ... When I first moved here most of the apartments were under 900 for splitting a four bedroom with three other roommates. Now less than 25% of them are. I used to think that I would live here for a long time, and now I don't. It gets even harder as someone who has a disability and need to find a flexile apartment. I also think about, I work with a lot of disabled people in the Boston area, and for so many of them, when people ask me, ""How do I find an accessible apartment?"" I'm having trouble.

And we got jumped on our way coming back from bowling and car of young white men, young white boys jumped out and started to swing at us with golf clubs. I remember getting hit at my chest and the club breaking off. And ironically, how we got out of that, a vehicle stopped with an interracial couple. And then the neighbors who saw who were all white, came down to help us because they didn't feel what was happening was right which is true.

And we got jumped on our way coming back from bowling and car of young white men, young white boys jumped out and started to swing at us with golf clubs. I remember getting hit at my chest and the club breaking off. And ironically, how we got out of that, a vehicle stopped with an interracial couple. And then the neighbors who saw who were all white, came down to help us because they didn't feel what was happening was right which is true. And so that really tainted my view on some of the race issues, because at around the same time we were being bused as well, from Dorchester to, I was bused from Dorchester to West Roxbury- the Joyce Kilmer. So that touched my life. And then something else that really resonated with me too that's worthy of calling out is the issues that this country, the world is facing with climate change. And it's a real thing. And Boston, like this storm coming the T-stop in the South Bay has to be four to five, so that the station wouldn't get a flood with the anticipated storm coming. So it is real. There'll be more storms like this. And I'm working to get the word around about climate change.

They really overlap with a lot of the different things that we are concerned about at this table right now. And if we can see the connection, you can see how important it is to act today. With mental health, we don't really see it as a job issue, but it really is because when lives are stable and incomes are comparable to the national average, lives are better and the stress is less and you don't look for self-medication and you treat your kids better.

Eventually, I had to leave them because at that point, at that time, I didn't know who to get in touch with to help them. And that broke my heart, that I couldn't do anything for them. But I was able to feed them and sit and have a conversation for a couple of hours and left my friends and let them go on. So that saddens me. The homelessness has gotten worse.

There were times that folks, whoever would pull the fire alarm and the white kids and the black kids, 1976, I would come out and it would be a riot. I would have to go back into a school full of white kids that fought my friends. So the busing ever ... We've talked about racism, we've talked about our experiences and our story, but that just brought me back and it was a trigger for me because you can't put a bandaid on racism because it's like putting salt in the wound. It festers. I'm feeling this now. Jamal, my mother was a foster parent and she probably had about 30 young children that called her mother. I had a whole bunch of mothers, bro, [inaudible]. She made the best fried chicken in the world and I got a recipe now. But to see you as a father, with the stereotype of black men, I see it right here. You have two beautiful daughters. I see that. Right? And when they say black men left their families, there were no father figures for you, but there, you're doing something special. You're doing something that a lot of black men do.

So what accountability measures are being placed for a program that's being funded by the taxpayers, that's being built by the city, and all these different things, and it's just like the ball is passed to folks that are not managing it appropriately. And in a space where there's a lot of just disorganization, and they're not being honest about things. And they're saying, ""Oh, this person's rejecting it, and not creating a full picture."" We're never going to be able to meet the demand. If the folks that you were doing business with, you're not making it clear to them that this is your expectation. And if you don't meet the expectation, the result is you will no longer have a contract as a property management company. And I feel just all around, there's just no accountability period for anyone.

So I couldn't get those high paying jobs, because didn't had a education, but I had the experience, you know what I mean? So it goes all the way back to the affordable housing, I would be content, if I didn't have to raise my child and make sure he was equipped. If I didn't have to work two jobs, it's hard trying to juggle school work and your child, you know what I mean? So, I think we need to bring back affordable housing which is really affordable to middle class people, working people because when you are working, in my experience, you can't get certain benefits, you can't get TAFDC, you can't get food stamps, snap as you all call it benefits anymore, because you are overqualified. You have to qualify first before you can get this snap. And so stuff like that helps and it benefits your child. But the working class, if we make over a certain amount, we can get that affordable housing, quote, unquote, we can get the support that other families can get. And people that, basically, I'm not going to say we don't need it. But what I'm saying is, we all need it. We all need support. We all need a hand. So, don't look at my income and say that it's less than somebody else that has lower income. My needs is the same as that other person. So if my needs are not being met, right? How can I afford it? So their needs is not being met by this programming to help them meet those needs. But there's no programming for us middle class. So my question is, when are we going to have affordable housing?

So when I was growing up, when we first came to America from Haiti, my parents, we lived in Everett. And so I went to the Everett school systems. And once you get to high school, there was actually... Everett Cooperative Bank is within the high school. And that was a class that you take. And I took the class for two years. And so you go through the class, they teach you everything about banking, you actually do banking within the schools, kids have accounts and all that, once you graduate, they then position you into the actual branch outside, where you now have a job as you graduate, and you're going through the whole banking system. And so that's something that since in Boston, I've been trying to figure out every corner you turn around, there's a bank, somewhere, but I don't see that being implemented at all. And a big question for me is that we've been talking about entrepreneurs and businesses and loans, but there hasn't been any discussions on personal. You're building these homes, you're building these spaces, we can't afford them because we can't get loans. So where's the disconnect? Where are the conversations that are being had to know that everything is interconnected? So if you want us to be able to access the generational wealth, typically, in order for us to access it, we need to get a loan in order for us to make that purchase. And we know that through the banking system, it's very predatory practices, it's just absolute. Structural racism within the banking system is just out of this world. And I think that that's one of the ways that we need to make sure that we can start to attack some of the challenges and issues that we're having in our communities, you see more check cashing places than you actually see banks. And then the banks that are opened, there's no sense of community, you can't go in there, there's no one that really knows your name, no one's actually sitting there to try to figure out what they can screen you for, what products they have that would work for you. It's just taking your money and then not investing into any of the programming around you. And investing in anything that's beneficial for you. But meanwhile, you're giving them your hard earned funds constantly. And that's something that I would really love to see an elected, at least try to acknowledge or convene the banking systems in all the different places that we have, to start to have conversations on how do they better approach people of color, and making sure that the products that they have available work for us, and if our credit scores are not good enough, or we're not meeting the requirements, what programs do you have in place to help us get there? How can you usher us into a new space where we can walk into your space, and be able to say, ""I'd like a loan, please.""

So when I was growing up, when we first came to America from Haiti, my parents, we lived in Everett. And so I went to the Everett school systems. And once you get to high school, there was actually... Everett Cooperative Bank is within the high school. And that was a class that you take. And I took the class for two years. And so you go through the class, they teach you everything about banking, you actually do banking within the schools, kids have accounts and all that, once you graduate, they then position you into the actual branch outside, where you now have a job as you graduate, and you're going through the whole banking system. And so that's something that since in Boston, I've been trying to figure out every corner you turn around, there's a bank, somewhere, but I don't see that being implemented at all. And a big question for me is that we've been talking about entrepreneurs and businesses and loans, but there hasn't been any discussions on personal.

And so yeah, how do we move sort of beyond that is the question. And my experience is, in high school, I was in a Mass experimental school system and we had this system called the model high. And it was part of, like they had a lower school, middle and upper. And one of the things about it was that a lot of the young people that went, they went because they were either kicked out or had difficulty either learn differently or whatever in the traditional school system. And so as an experiment, I thought that this is a skewed experiment because what you're doing is that you're loading the experimental school. If you're really trying to understand what could be a more advantageous school system or whatever, and you put it with folks who, in a lot of way anybody whose kid was doing well in the traditional system wouldn't take them out and put them in an experiment.

And the kid is in the middle, you can see his book.

It's speaks to all the issues that we have nationwide, especially when you look at the distribution of wealth and how huge that divide is where just a handful of people owe more than 40% of the wealth in the United States and how are we going to move forward as a society if we continue to invest in a form of capitalism that obviously isn't working for most of us and hasn't been working for most of us.
