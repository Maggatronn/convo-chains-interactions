I was, as I mentioned before, the guns, I work a later shift and I get home sometimes after nine o'clock and when I get home after nine o'clock, I'm concerned with nothing other than coming down from the T station. I'm glad the commuter rail is just right up the street from where I live because I take the commuter rail. I no longer take the red line or the buses. I'll get on the commuter rail, go into work, go into the office. I'm so concerned when I get out of the office because I work at the C point area which is very safe. There's always tons of people walking around. There's the long wharf and then there's the international, Intercontinental, I'm sorry, Hotel so there's always a bunch of tourists around. There's always transit police and police because it's the downtown area so I'm not concerned so much walking from my office when it's dark at night, ask the eight o'clock to south station. But sometimes when I arrived Blue Hill Labs Station where I get off, there's a big old long platform and a big old long ramp. So what I did was I was, because sometimes people are just sitting there. I don't know, maybe, watching trains but it's late at night, they're just sitting there guys. So what I did was I asked the engineer, I said, ""Look, when you get to Blue Hill Avenue, could you possibly pull closest possible to that ramp?"" And he said, ""You ain't going towards the rebuilt area?"" And I said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Yeah."" He said, ""That's a long platform."" I said, ""Yes it is."" And he said, ""That's a long ramp."" And I said, ""I'm glad you know that."" He said, ""I never know where to stop because some people do when they exit the train, they go towards the Blue Hill Lab but I go towards Cummins Highway because I live on that side."" And most people it's maybe one or two people they will get off. Me and another woman or me and another guy but there's never more than two or three people that will get off at that stop. So he started pulling close as possible, going towards [inaudible] so I don't have to walk up the long platform to get to the ramp and then walk up the ramp. The ramp is so long, I don't know if anyone has ever taken the commuter rail or has entered that station, but they have benches that you could rest because it's so long. So lately there's been some crazy guys sitting on those benches with their mask on and stuff like and it's kind of scary too. You never know if someone's waiting there, they going to knock you upside your head or when you exit out of the station on Cummins Highway, they're doing construction up there so it's always kind of dark. The trucks and stuff are everywhere. When I'm crossing the street I'm always feeling nervous because those bike racks are in the way and then it's so dark that if you're walking across, the cars may not be able to see you and you don't know who may be they're waiting with a gun or whatever. I always think about the guys that were shot a few years ago at that barbecue. They're sitting in a car or outside of our car and then the grandmother that was just sitting on her porch and some random shooting or something like that. Where do these... I could be coming out the station and somebody may be chasing someone else out of matter Penn square and I may get shot by a stray bullet or something.

And because of that, people are much more irritated and frustrated and the honk and the phones and so on.

So I think the noise level has increased due to the, I don't know who made the decision about where to decrease those lanes, but it's an annoyance and it's an irritant and it's causing a lot of noise pollution. So when, Mish I think you even talked about serenity and peace and whatever, it brought me to that, that we have increased the amount of noise due to people's irritation and frustration with those lanes. So I don't know if I'm doing a disservice to the people who are bicyclists. But I think that whoever made the decision could have done a better job in finding the routes that they needed to to amend with these bicycles. Some of those roads weren't built for that, and some of the residents in those areas have been complaining. One woman told me in order to get around the corner to a store that she frequented in the past, now it takes two times, three times as long to get there because now there's only one lane versus two that were available in the past.

So when, Mish I think you even talked about serenity and peace and whatever, it brought me to that, that we have increased the amount of noise due to people's irritation and frustration with those lanes. So I don't know if I'm doing a disservice to the people who are bicyclists. But I think that whoever made the decision could have done a better job in finding the routes that they needed to to amend with these bicycles. Some of those roads weren't built for that, and some of the residents in those areas have been complaining. One woman told me in order to get around the corner to a store that she frequented in the past, now it takes two times, three times as long to get there because now there's only one lane versus two that were available in the past. So the noise pollution for me is something. I love my trees and grass and peace so I'm speaking with regard to peace.",Kathy,,infrastructure.transportation,

That's a good idea. The flashlight you mean as far as crossing the street because it was dark over there. Because it's dark, just a flashlight period.

His behavior went off the charts. At one time he was hospitalized and it continues. What people don't understand is that grief doesn't have a deadline. The way one person deals with grief is different from the way another. Some people are just thrown off and they never recover. That's difficult to believe but they never do. They never do. And the start of my son's issues and problems was because he lost his father. He was very close to his father. I used to say to my brother that he loved his father more than he loved me. I didn't regret that I didn't have a problem with it but just to give you a sense of the relationship. And so from the time, the way my son responds to his father's passing, I always describe it as though a hole in the world opened up and he fell in because nothing was the same after that. I can give you, oh my gosh, a book of the things that went wrong. So when it comes to grief and mental health and needing help, it is not a week long thing. It cannot be. It has to be ongoing and there has to be experts who recognize the severity, the gravity of the situation. They have to have a safe space which many young people don't.

Prior to losing my son, if anyone had asked me if Dorchester was a safe place, I probably would have said I felt safe because I wasn't aware of what was going on. But after losing my son, I was exposed to so many younger people and they would share with me what their world is like and I didn't know we lived in two different worlds. Their worlds are way different than our worlds and they do collide because as an adult, you could be walking down the street or simply driving your car and you could get killed and that's scary to think that you could sit on your porch and get killed on your porch like that woman that was up in Upham's Corner, she was an elderly person, I think in her 80s or something, just minding her business on her porch and she was taken, she was stolen. And so was my son, my son was stolen. And it's aggravating to think that we have to keep losing. We have to keep having these losses. And it seems like nobody is doing anything to help.

And I think it's just recognizing there's going to be a gap between people like me and people that have been here and that are fighting to stay here, and this motivates a lot of what I want to eventually do in my career as well, which is focusing on community development. So yeah, I think the main experience is coming to a city as a transplant, recognizing there's a lot of shared struggle and oppression that I do have with people that look like me, but there's also a really big gap in the experiences between transplants like me and people who have been here and want to stay here and just no longer can afford to.",Somala,,inequality.race-based,

And then, the other thing that we, well, I always think about is that the leadership comes in different forms and this is something that Jasmine said, and why is it that people are always looking for leadership to look a certain way? Leadership looks so different with so many different people in our neighborhoods. I often wonder about the youth in our neighborhood, everybody's looking for the shiny, bright youth in our neighborhood. What about the youth that are struggling? They could be shiny and bright too. Invest in them, which is something somebody else said. I'm sorry my memory's a little [inaudible]. But, why do we have to pick and choose who we speak to, and why do we need gatekeepers to protect our neighborhood and our neighbors? Why do we need to protect them? So, all this is all about the way City and institutions have treated our neighborhoods and the people that live here. I know that I raised two Afro-Latinas and they struggle so hard in the paths that they've chosen. One in trauma, following my footsteps, and the other one decided, she's at school, ""Everybody I'm just going into the Military."" So it was a little shock. But she went into the Military where you don't see too many Latinas in the field that she's in. She's in chemicals. So, I struggle and fight with different institutions and different people for them to understand that our neighborhoods are worth fighting for and that we need to fight, not with each other, but to empower each other, which is something that you all have said in different ways. So I'm just all over the place because I agree with everything everybody said. And I have an accent but you only hear it when I'm angry and you only hear the southern part.

So you start thinking, it's just not going to work. But, we are all passionate about it. We all want to see a better Boston and we're all willing to do the groundwork that nobody else wants to do to get it there. So, I'm very happy to be part of a group of people that are actually eager to do the work and are willing to do it. And I just want to appreciate everyone for sharing their thoughts, sharing your experiences. It's like when you go to Hawaii and you get a smell of different air, right, it's not the same overwhelming, same thing each and every single day?

And I guess the experience I had coming to Boston, for example for college, when I came in 2016 to Northeastern, I always heard about the different neighborhoods within the area. But everyone is just like, ""Oh, go to this neighborhood, then go to that neighborhood."" And I think people don't think like why different neighborhoods are different. And I one of the things we always noticed, is just differences in education, differences in support system within each community.
