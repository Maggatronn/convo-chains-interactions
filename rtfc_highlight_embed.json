I was at a job that I loved for almost five years, and because I don't go to places to change things, I went there to be a good fit. I was a counselor in the human services field. I'll speed this up, but I wrote an email, because they offered the COVID vaccine to the families of the employees except for two persons of color, myself and someone else. I spoke up about that, and in the email I wrote that the company was no stranger to systemic racism, and because I used those two words, they found two reasons to get rid of me. They said, my paperwork wasn't at the par, and that I was late a few times. After I sent the email they responded eight days later to my email. People didn't speak to me around the office. They were afraid to have conversations with me after I used those two words. And I had just been given a raise, a $3 raise by the way. And I had just been given that raise retroactively a whole year back for my performance, but yet I was fired for not having good performance. That's why when you made that statement about what people hold so dear about Boston, I spent every day working for that organization, helping other people to try to get their lives on track. And in a moment after sending that email off, my whole life was turned upside down, and I lost a lot. I just had my credit on track, I was thinking of purchasing a home, so I can move out of the punch that that I live in.

So anyway, I spent the next 15 years trying to understand that and study it. And I have come to understand that most people who are leaders in our nation don't know the history of structural racism. So my question is probably, what are you going to understand the history of structural racism and how it impacts us today and what you're going to do about it? Drop the mic.

Then I want you to speak to that person and tell them why their question or experience resonated with you and share a story from your life that connects with their experience. So I'm going to give everybody a minute to do that. And actually the last conversation we had so much in common that we didn't say specifically. So this is an upgrade, especially for those who will be doing conversations because we're assuming there'll be people that have different questions and come from different walks of life. And we really want the opportunity for people in these conversations to share directly with somebody else and make that personal connection. So who would like to go first?

I moved here after living in Grove Hall and I came to shell shock because over there I had Black neighbors like myself and then I came here and it was primarily white. My first experience was going up to the playground in Mission Hill and having a white kid punched me in the face, no reason at all. And then our first encounter was my sister having to beat him up. And then in the fall, turns out that he's in my class. And so this is the beginning of my life as a middle schooler, listening to the stories of the high school and them having race wars and us fighting with our friends who were friends in school but as soon as we crossed the street from the Catholic middle school that we went to, then it was all hell that broke out. And so I became an activist when I was 14, very young. And probably at that time subconsciously leading to my adult life as an activist, I never did anything in Mission Hill. I never wanted to have anything to do with this area, but sleeping. And so I think that probably about three or four years ago, I joined the board of our neighborhood bus but before that, I still had a lot of that animosity. So the systemic racism that exists now as the community and cultural engagement manager at Mass General hospital, I'm doing my best to break down a lot of those walls and having to fight with white people to get them to see why this is not a handout or a hand up, but it's just telling them that they as a system need to give back to a community that they've turned their back on for so many years."}, {"x": 8, "y": 9, "x_trans": 814, "y_trans": 357, "cluster": 8, "id": 5244664, "words": "What resonated most with me was Priestess'.

And I could pull from my history something applicable. So I think I might honor all three and say a little bit about all. In terms of Cindy's experience with racism, growing up, I remember walking home from Boston Bowl and this is on the east side of Washington. And it was four of us. We were all Black from the west side of Washington and the only way to get to Boston Bowl was walk. And we got jumped on our way coming back from bowling and car of young white men, young white boys jumped out and started to swing at us with golf clubs. I remember getting hit at my chest and the club breaking off. And ironically, how we got out of that, a vehicle stopped with an interracial couple. And then the neighbors who saw who were all white, came down to help us because they didn't feel what was happening was right which is true. And so that really tainted my view on some of the race issues, because at around the same time we were being bused as well, from Dorchester to, I was bused from Dorchester to West Roxbury- the Joyce Kilmer. So that touched my life. And then something else that really resonated with me too that's worthy of calling out is the issues that this country, the world is facing with climate change. And it's a real thing. And Boston, like this storm coming the T-stop in the South Bay has to be four to five, so that the station wouldn't get a flood with the anticipated storm coming. So it is real. There'll be more storms like this. And I'm working to get the word around about climate change. And then the third aspect is the mental health issues and challenges that we as a community face. They really overlap with a lot of the different things that we are concerned about at this table right now. And if we can see the connection, you can see how important it is to act today. With mental health, we don't really see it as a job issue, but it really is because when lives are stable and incomes are comparable to the national average, lives are better and the stress is less and you don't look for self-medication and you treat your kids better. So the quality of life all the way around where all of these things seem seemingly not connected are very interwoven like a sweater. So we have to really take a mindset of all the challenges that we have."}, {"x": 9, "y": 8, "x_trans": 862, "y_trans": 342, "cluster": 8, "id": 5244666, "words": "I resonated like Corey with a little bit of what everyone is saying, but I'm going to talk a little bit about what Cindy's point was about gun violence, more advocacy towards gun violence prevention and protection and just violence in the community in general. Sometimes it's not just about weapons. I'm going to get a little bit intimate here and share something that happened to me recently. Last winter, I was in crisis and I had lost my phone. Well, actually my phone had broke and then I had lost it. It was raining really bad that day. And I went into crisis and I was looking for a phone to use. I was near a friend's house. So I said, let me walk to this friend's house because usually they are at home, maybe I can use their phone and get a ride back to my house or whatever I got to do. So I was on my way to the friend's house and I saw the friend in that area. So I didn't even make it to their house. And I was asking them, \"Oh hey, my phone got wet in the rain. I don't have a bus pass. I need to call a ride. Can I use your phone?\" And they was like, \"Oh, my phone's off. I'm going to go pay my bill now.\" So I was going to go with them to pay their bill. So I asked, \"Can I just walk with you or whatever?\" And they act like they didn't know me. So that led me to go to wait for them at their house. They said, I could wait for them at their house because they didn't know how long it was going to take. So I got a little antsy. So I knocked on a neighbor's door and they opened the door and I asked them, I said, \"Hey, I need some help. I just need to use a phone. I'm a friend of your neighbors.\" And I've seen them before and they've seen me before and they just started attacking. So you can imagine how strange that was. It was a very serious altercation. It was more than one person attacking me. Someone called the ambulance because I was obviously beaten up and I had to go to Boston Medical and mind you, I still had no phone. And my family started worrying about me. They had to put a missing persons report because remember I had no phone, I wasn't home. And I was never able to use someone else's phone. And it bothered me that when somebody could be needing help or something and they knock on your door and the first thing you do is attack them, you don't try to give, you know what I mean, help them out and see if there's anything, if they need to use a phone or if you could show them where the ... just help out instead of ... like, the first instinct was for these people to attack me. Why? I don't know."}, {"x": 9, "y": 8, "x_trans": 936, "y_trans": 338, "cluster": 13, "id": 5244667, "words": "And so that never made sense to me, but the police did come to the hospital and stuff, but they didn't really do a good job of asking me what was going on. And on top of that, I was really injured. I had to have MRIs and brain scans and stuff like that because I was disoriented at that point because of the blows to the head. And so I feel like a lot of this violence that does happen goes back into mental health. A lot of people have mental health issues and they're not dealing with them. A lot of people have been traumatized. Maybe that person has an old trauma about someone coming to their door and that's why they responded that way. Or even just being trauma informed can ... even people who don't want to admit they've been traumatized or anything, or if they actually weren't, but being trauma informed will allow us to be more considerate of the people around us and to be more gentle and be more kind and understand that everyone goes through different periods of their life where you might lose someone and that can put you in grief and there's trauma support for that.

They're just ...\" This, that and the other. It touched my heart because I ended up ... One girl started crying because she wasn't from Massachusetts. She had been brought here by someone else. I really didn't know what to do except to actually go and get them some food and sit there on the sidewalk with them and just listen to them. And basically, at that point, that's what they needed, just somebody to listen and really believe. They needed some help. Eventually, I had to leave them because at that point, at that time, I didn't know who to get in touch with to help them. And that broke my heart, that I couldn't do anything for them.

All their childhood experiences, it's a lot of traumatic stories and trauma related to their first five years of life. So that's where it prompted me to have the question of, why can't we make it a child-orientated world instead of an adult-orientated world? So that's where I started to ponder on that question. So that's what made me think. The first five years of a child's life is so important. Those experiences are almost even more important than the whole education, 12 years or 14 years or whatever of their education.

And they would spit on me, drunk, and I would have to go into Cub Scout smelling of liquor and spit. I can still smell the liquor. One of the opening songs we were saying is my country ... Or recite, \"My country, 'tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty,\" but I didn't feel very free. Fast forward, as the executive director of the community center I used to go to as a child, as the assistant director going into the director, I was initiated with the child steward tragedy in 1989 in October. I can remember the date and time, seeing black men being strip-searched, civil rights savagely violated. I'm being the director and I had to turn around because I didn't want to be subjected to it. These were my friends. These were my participants in the community center, people that grew up with me, family members. Actually, my cousin, who was a former city councilor, was one of the kids. I skipped over something very important because I know that education is pointing ... And this has been in the news. One of the most prominent high schools in the city of Boston throughout the country, the first public school ... In the seventh grade, I was accepted in Boston Latin. I did not want to go there, but my mother made me go there. But during my tenure there in the seventh grade, I was called the N-word by a teacher. So I continued to fight for the freedom, the liberation of black boys and black men. I have a 21-year-old son. Every time I look at the news, I'm afraid of the young people I've helped, the brothers I see. When I opened up, I said I'm emotionally, spiritually in that zone, trying to deal with life. I lost a friend, I'm speaking at his funeral tomorrow, who happens to be connected to an elected official, our mayor. I fought to help black men with an effort to form a commission that was denied.

You know what I'm saying? But I've experienced racism in a lot of things of that nature. But if you honor each person, whether they're Chinese, they're black, they're Asian, white, whatever, you start teaching this in school, child honoring. It's called child honoring. You teach it in school. As they grow up, they'll learn, regardless of their parents' ideology about different races, they'll respect and honor that human being and work with that human being. Diversity is our strength. So my story does connect with all of them. Right now, we're in a culture of just extreme anger, entitlement, violence, anger violence, gun violence, drug, pandemic. All these pandemics and this culture, it's crazy.

I can remember vividly with my dad having to go out and scrape his car off from eggs, being egged overnight, nigga being written on the fence, being called that all the time, in school, constant riots all the time.

There were times that folks, whoever would pull the fire alarm and the white kids and the black kids, 1976, I would come out and it would be a riot. I would have to go back into a school full of white kids that fought my friends. So the busing ever ...

So I speak from my experience, because I had the opportunity to sit in a meeting with Arne Duncan, who is the former Secretary of Education. And this was a meeting where students from all across the country, we sat down, we talked with him. And we just got to talk, what is our education system looking like? And I'm from Boston, Harvard's down the sheet, Wentworth, MIT, all these schools. But in my mind, and I'm actually talking with the kids that I work with now, they're juniors and seniors [inaudible] O' Bryant School. And they're like, they read these books that like, \"The next day, we don't remember what we read.\" And it's interesting because I think that when I actually talked with Arnie Duncan, I told him straight up, I was like, \"You look like you're really outstanding man. So why is it that we don't have classes on financing? Why can't we teach cooking class? Why can we teach home economic classes? Why can we not teach our youth how to make a garden? How to cook for yourself? How to buy a car? How to do these things? Why does our family members have to do this on our own and teach and teach us when.\" I feel it makes sense in education system, we should be learning that specific fact. I mean, the weather cycle is great and all, but teach the foundations of life first and then you can proceed to electives as in like, language and... I mean, language is of course important but teach stuff on first. And it's interesting because I think that that's something education is once we're going to do it, you have to be a public school, or a private school, or a charter school to start your own curriculum. But I think that it's important to start teaching, especially Black and Brown youth, we shouldn't wait until you're in your 20s to start learning about finance.

So my personal experience is I entered the lottery for one of these new buildings, and the lotteries through the city, but then once you get accepted, it then gets pushed to the property management company. And the property management companies have tactics in place to deter folks from actually being placed within those units. So what accountability measures are being placed for a program that's being funded by the taxpayers, that's being built by the city, and all these different things, and it's just like the ball is passed to folks that are not managing it appropriately.

If the folks that you were doing business with, you're not making it clear to them that this is your expectation. And if you don't meet the expectation, the result is you will no longer have a contract as a property management company. And I feel just all around, there's just no accountability period for anyone. Folks just get to do what they want to do, they put a really great picture on, they write eloquent words, they create this whole pie chart and graphs without actually implementing any other measures or showing all the progress that was made.

I was a single mom, make sure he was able to go into programs and go to community centers and stuff like that. But I got to work in order for him to do that. You know what I mean? And the centers wasn't cheap. The program wasn't cheap. And me, because I couldn't afford education, [inaudible] had the money for it, my years and... So there's another question, education versus years and your position. If I got the experience, years of experience, but I don't have the education, when does that going to count again? Just because somebody was able to afford a education doesn't mean that they have knowledge and understanding or understand the population that they're dealing with. So I couldn't get those high paying jobs, because didn't had a education, but I had the experience, you know what I mean? So it goes all the way back to the affordable housing, I would be content, if I didn't have to raise my child and make sure he was equipped. If I didn't have to work two jobs, it's hard trying to juggle school work and your child, you know what I mean? So, I think we need to bring back affordable housing which is really affordable to middle class people, working people because when you are working, in my experience, you can't get certain benefits, you can't get TAFDC, you can't get food stamps, snap as you all call it benefits anymore, because you are overqualified. You have to qualify first before you can get this snap. And so stuff like that helps and it benefits your child.

When I got out of high school, I got a job working at Fidelity Mutual Funds. And that's when I learned some of those things. But no, it wasn't taught to me in school. But there are schools and most of these schools are not in our inner city that teaches young people on finances. And that's where our officials have to have our school committees to implement these these courses into our school. Finances, which is so true.

[inaudible], you got the apartment.

I think Debra and [inaudible 00:3 7:05]talked about the housing. I think that's the most important thing. And as a parent, when you talked about juggling work, school, and raising kids. That's something that not a lot of people that I know are... They don't have that knowledge of how to balance all of that together and also get a house. Usually, I mean, people in my generation, or at least or friends or my circle, they're just getting housing and trying to... If you scroll on Instagram, Facebook, it's like, \"Okay, who has the latest job? Who has the latest features or car?\" But our parents weren't worried about that, they were worried about is this the house I want? Is this is this rent good? I remember, my family was moving from... Obviously, when I was growing up, I didn't care where I lived, it was whatever it was good enough for me. But we moved from our apartment to a house. And that in and of itself, was the greatest thing for my family. It's now we have a house. And the idea of home ownership. I don't think people in the inner city understand that. You can literally, if you are a good parent, you can be looking at your children, and they won't see the suburbs or the rural areas and be like, \"I want that.\" Though we see on TV, and understand that that's the life, but they won't look up to you and be like, \"We need to have a house.\" But you are thinking, \"We need a house. This is what I want. I want to create generational wealth.\" And that's something that I think people in my circle didn't grow up with that idea. It was just everything's here, we have an apartment, we have our household, we have education. But the idea of now getting affordable housing is something that is coming to the forefront of my mind. And how do you make sense of getting affordable housing? Where's the right place to do it? And thinking about not just getting a house but if you want to have a family, how do you now choose the right location for a school. How do you choose it, where you have good hospitals near you? And I think it's something that goes back to education, not just finances, though we need to understand how does housing happen? How do you make sure someone is held accountable if they're not hiring their friends to get this in the housing? How do you make sure everything connects and fits. And that's why I take it back to education, because if we're not just learning about 400 years of history, or the weather cyber, which is sometimes... It's important, but if we all are at the same understanding of what is going on our society, and I think you've talked about civic engagement. Voting, we don't talk about that in school at all. And it doesn't make any sense because there are so... You'll see signs of this mayor, this person for councilor, it's like, \"Who is this person?\" We're seeing these people every single day, but you don't understand your role. And I think it's also how to not only accountability for people who are in places in power, but how do we take accountability for ourselves, because we are citizens who have so much power. We have the power to vote, but not only that, we have the power to learn and make active change, to create community spaces, sit down and do it. But how do we understand our role? And it's because we're not taught at all. We're not taught that we have one. And we need to know that we do have one."}, {"x": 8, "y": 10, "x_trans": 826, "y_trans": 497, "cluster": 8, "id": 5244677, "words": "Thank you for that. For me, Miss Debra, your story resonated with me when it comes to banking and loans and financing. So when I was growing up, when we first came to America from Haiti, my parents, we lived in Everett. And so I went to the Everett school systems. And once you get to high school, there was actually... Everett Cooperative Bank is within the high school. And that was a class that you take. And I took the class for two years. And so you go through the class, they teach you everything about banking, you actually do banking within the schools, kids have accounts and all that, once you graduate, they then position you into the actual branch outside, where you now have a job as you graduate, and you're going through the whole banking system. And so that's something that since in Boston, I've been trying to figure out every corner you turn around, there's a bank, somewhere, but I don't see that being implemented at all. And a big question for me is that we've been talking about entrepreneurs and businesses and loans, but there hasn't been any discussions on personal. You're building these homes, you're building these spaces, we can't afford them because we can't get loans. So where's the disconnect? Where are the conversations that are being had to know that everything is interconnected? So if you want us to be able to access the generational wealth, typically, in order for us to access it, we need to get a loan in order for us to make that purchase. And we know that through the banking system, it's very predatory practices, it's just absolute. Structural racism within the banking system is just out of this world. And I think that that's one of the ways that we need to make sure that we can start to attack some of the challenges and issues that we're having in our communities, you see more check cashing places than you actually see banks. And then the banks that are opened, there's no sense of community, you can't go in there, there's no one that really knows your name, no one's actually sitting there to try to figure out what they can screen you for, what products they have that would work for you. It's just taking your money and then not investing into any of the programming around you. And investing in anything that's beneficial for you. But meanwhile, you're giving them your hard earned funds constantly. And that's something that I would really love to see an elected, at least try to acknowledge or convene the banking systems in all the different places that we have, to start to have conversations on how do they better approach people of color, and making sure that the products that they have available work for us, and if our credit scores are not good enough, or we're not meeting the requirements, what programs do you have in place to help us get there? How can you usher us into a new space where we can walk into your space, and be able to say, \"I'd like a loan, please.\" Actually, we don't even need to be able to ask for a loan, you should be coming to us because you go everywhere else, and you send fliers to X, Y and Z and you say, \"You're pre approved for this amount of money.\" But how do we improve that line of communication and the ability for us to feel we can go to banks and be able to access the funds like we know a lot of other people can."}, {"x": 8, "y": 10, "x_trans": 813, "y_trans": 494, "cluster": 8, "id": 5244678, "words": "So I connect with everybody as well.

Because connecting with Ben, you're not educating us at a young age, you're not educating us to be able to get a loan, you know what I mean? And to know that something isn't right within these systems, you know what I mean? So, who is this all for? Because it's not for us. If this is our community that we live in, tailor it to our community. So that's what just comes into my mind. We don't get educated... We have these things implemented, but we don't get the knowledge to how to handle it. How do we walk in it? How do we deal with it? How are we able to... Okay If we do get that house, how do we maintain it? If we do get that a loan, how do we maintain it? We do not get taught how to maintain what we do have, you know what I mean? And it's because we're so busy trying to obtain some things that we can't be taught. Because we're trying to hold on to the little bit we have, but if we were taught as a young age, so that goes to back to me relating with Ben, we're taught at a young age about finances, the basic life skills of learning how to cook, learning how to saw, learning how to change tires. And I learned these things in school. We had these things in school, but as the years went by, what happened? They got cut. These things got cut from the system, what just go, what's you saying? We have Boston High who who did something like what you did. There's no more Boston High. Madison is the only school that I know, vocational school right now.

And then you have to raise your child, you have to figure out what is society? What is community? And that's the idea of why is it feel everybody has to do it alone? Why is the community... I'm not saying that it's up to the community, because there should already be systems in place, because due to a [inaudible] racism, we're already marginalized by this.

At what point do we take our power and our choice back to ensure that the systems that we know are here actually start to work for us? We are living in a digital age now where we have access to YouTube and articles and all these other things. And so how much are we taking advantage of these critical information to help us to frame our understanding of what's happening in our communities? And so we are under 400 years of oppression where it's a constant catch up, and we haven't had an opportunity to once just usher into a space where we can finally be, but at the same time, in reverence and honor to our ancestors and folks that came before us, the tireless work that they've put out before us and becoming the first and dismantling here, mantling that, when do we take that back and prioritize it and put it at the very forefront? Because when desegregation occurred, it wasn't for us, it was to access our money. Because they knew that within a Black community, we are one of the biggest spenders. So what we had is never going to be equal because it wasn't with the intention of creating this for us to thrive and be, it was created just to give us a glimpse and make us feel we're a part when we're not. Our money is a part, our money is counted. But when it comes to proper education, and housing, and healthcare and everything else that other folks have lighter skin tones have an opportunity and access to, we are denied that.

Yeah, I say to myself, thinking that if I can put together a computer network, physical computer network, and have a nonprofit organization, I might invite in US citizens that are striving to develop their skills in the IT department, and come in and work at it to try to gain those skills, because the knowledge they're getting in colleges, like the community college, I guess isn't enough. You're not allowed to take the computers apart, work with it, experiment. They only let you do a certain level of configuration, but that's it. When you go out into the real world, it's a lot different. It's a lot, lot different. You won't understand Excel. Okay, I've got two certificates from Excel at a really good IT school, and in Excel, they got us to do a couple of links to a couple of pages, do a couple of formulas, and that was about it, where you can go in and enter the information in this page, and the information will appear in the next page. You might type a form in MS Word, and then embed the information from Excel to that Word form, and that was it. I mean, it looked great. It was fantastic to learn it. But when I got into the work environment and I got handed a Excel document, it's a good thing I was strong with Excel, because that Excel document had about 500 different lines that I had to go through looking to do that entry and the make sure that there was no mistakes in the other part of the balance sheet, another page on the Excel. And if it did, I had to find where the mistake was. That was a big difference. In the community college, it was just two links to two pages, but in the real world, it was a huge [crosstalk]. Okay.

And one of the things about it was that a lot of the young people that went, they went because they were either kicked out or had difficulty either learn differently or whatever in the traditional school system. And so as an experiment, I thought that this is a skewed experiment because what you're doing is that you're loading the experimental school. If you're really trying to understand what could be a more advantageous school system or whatever, and you put it with folks who, in a lot of way anybody whose kid was doing well in the traditional system wouldn't take them out and put them in an experiment. So we was filled with kids who had behavioral issues, or had some difficulty in a lot of ways in dealing with the typical system. And so that was one reason why I think that it never got on track because of the results.

And I'm also a parent in the school system. So I can see firsthand of how home culture can get confused with school culture and the school culture is totally different and teachers are doing the best that they can, but there will never be a connection without that home culture. So that's where they misunderstand and misinterpret our children's signs. Somebody might see my son as aggressive, but it's probably passionate or a cry for, \"I don't understand.\" When you have teaching tools or you're trying to say, \"Okay, well, this kid needs to learn social, emotional growth and tools to voice what the issue is that all school year, you say, \"It's okay, you can be mad. It's okay, you can be mad, but just tell us what you need.\" And then when you see that student actually voice what he needs and is not being listened to by the same people who drill the venom, \"We're here to listen,\" it's like, \"What?\" But then it's a lot of the policies to that have crippled some of these teachers and crippled the children that's trying to keep the children and the parents safe and also the teachers safe.

So public housing is a lot easier to pick up the phone and say, \"Hey, I think I have been racially discriminated,\" and they'll do something about it quicker, the private low-income housing. So that infrastructure too was just like, it's like, \"What?\" So they can take... If the property manager don't like you for whatever reason, it doesn't mean necessarily have to be something you did. Just by the color of your skin. They do little things. They'll take a lot longer to fix something or forget you completely.

We do have a lot of development that's going on in Mattapan, and I think that we could do a better job as individuals to know more about what that means, and then, also bringing in folks to share that information.

I find myself just getting some of that resistance. I don't own, and so I am one of those people in some of these spaces.

And bringing those folks in, and asking that when they do have these conversations, please start from the really basic, because I sometimes think that people are just not interested because they don't understand it, and maybe don't want to have those individuals coming into spaces, because they're just like, I'm not going to understand what they're talking about.

And you said that you did your research and you looked around. And I sat back and was like, \"That wasn't something that I actually did. I didn't actively do that.\" However, I do have friends who live outside of Boston, they live in Randolph and they don't have to search for the community meetings. They're welcome to come there. They're basically told to show up, whether it's a neighbor who comes by the house or however, they get your information and they're letting you know. And I'm not sure, there could be something that goes on in Boston, where they actually let folks know about the community meetings, and it's known or it's somewhere where people should be able to see it. But from my experience, it's not something that I hear about too often, of community meetings that are happening in Dorchester. So I just think about those conversations that are happening similar to this.

I couldn't imagine having to do it myself. So I just think that. Another note, right now, there's a whole crisis at, I think it's in Texas. There's a whole bunch of immigrants who are getting sent back to Haiti and just that whole process. It's an issue and it's relevant.

And there needs to be measures in place to reduce the bias of certain countries of origin. And certain cultures coming to the United States and to Boston in general.

A lot of students that was really the one thing that they pulled out of that workshop was, \"Oh, when you own a home, it just changes everything.\" And it's something that you don't really realize. And I remember there was a study that was done that within Boston, they discovered that the majority of black people who are in Boston earn so little compared to the rest of Boston terms of racial breakdown. But really understanding how home equity and home ownership can end really does make a difference, but it's something that not many people know about or don't even just know about, but they don't have the resources to know.

So that one really stood out to me seeing the education is a key factor to access. When it comes to looking for jobs and things like that, you need to degree or even you need a certificate. And not having access makes it that much harder. But seeing working with students, getting into these colleges, there may be a couple of colleges that may seem oh, it's very easy to get in. It's easy to get accepted, yada, yada. But as you're working through the transition process, you find out, you easily got accepted, but now you have to jump all of these hurdles. And then the number just drops from like students who actually matriculate. And I noticed that that's like a common theme across the board. And that's one of those examples of well, you were denied access, because of what? So you can look at some of the data and it paints this picture. The picture looks like racism or any other isms or whatever. When you look at the data and look at access and look at the students, the demographics are the students who just don't have access, like they did it at first. I can go on and on about that.

It doesn't matter how hard they work and what kind of activities they participate in, they still is a college is not guaranteed for all of them for few maybe depends on what people to have on their way. Even if they get through college, they graduate from college, but it's going to be hard for them to find a job because they are undocumented. And I hope that few years for now, and that's not going to be an issue for a lot of people, not just the students, but for a lot of people, a lot of hard working people.

Yeah, that's a huge. It's a huge issue. And I know a lot of people that have to move outside of the city, not just to rent, but also just to buy their home.

I've also met just people in my community that because South Korea, we still have conscription. And I know, there are definitely some young men who have not been able to go home for many, many years. Because they grew up here, they only speak English, but if they try to go back, they'll get arrested at the airport and drive to the army. So I know there's people haven't been able to go back home for a long time. And we, Korea also put a pause on adoption for the US, because a lot of Koreans that were adopted by US couples, a lot of them didn't bother to finish their paperwork. And so these kids became adults and then got deported to a country that they don't remember or speak the language of because their parents like didn't bother.

And where we are now, just some of the struggles and the access that we have. I mean, it's pretty unfortunate I find myself... I don't consider myself a Boston native, but I am born and raised here and I can't afford to stay here.

And so it will just be interesting to see what will it look like for those who are growing up who look exactly like me, who want to do the same thing. They also want to go off to school, they also want to continue to remain that good kid and come back and actually do work in their community, and then be embraced by it and be able to live here, instead of having to go to other cities, not knocking other cities around the US. It's beautiful for us to be able to travel and enjoy other spaces. But my friends are fleeing Boston, for many reasons and racial reasons, financial reasons, they're all leaving.

And it is really hard just seeing an entire country that's on fire but it also gives me hope in being surrounded by everyone here today who are just very justice-minded and wanting things to get better and wanting to do the work to make a more just society.

There are relatives, there are relatable and they connect. I think about this Boston that so many people admire, you watch the news and you see all the college students moving in to Boston, all over to go to school and you heat the parent on the news, talking about helping their child move in to go to school from Boston, because Boston has the best fist. We're leading in education, we have the best colleges and universities. Even Boston, Boston was promoted on Grey's Anatomy. The medical institutions down here was promoted on shows and other shows, but was promoted on stuff like Grey's Anatomy, Boston. And it's amazing, the view that people who live outside of the city has versus the view folks have that live within Boston. And just like I said, some folks are trying to get out of Boston. And I think that we need to be okay with that. I grew up in the city. I came to this country when I was seven years old, but I grew up in Boston, didn't know anything else, but Boston. And I would not buy a home in Boston. I just wouldn't. I am tired of the city. I'm tired of the violence in the city. I'm just tired. And there's a lot of collective trauma in the city of Boston that needs healing, collectively. Boston is traumatic. So there's benefits, but there's a lot of traumas in our community and a lot of trauma in Boston. There's just healing that needs to happen. I said it to somebody the other day when they try to entertain this conversation even about politics and the outcome of the mayoral race. I just feel like we're so confused. We're so divisive. The same people that yell unity are the same ones that are throwing out. Instead of being divisive, the same people that say we need to work together are the same people that are marginalizing other people and it's frustrating. I think there's definitely a balance, that you have to walk in optimism. Understanding you're going to be pessimistic, but just having a balance and not allow it to overtake you mentally, physically, emotionally, I just refuse. And if, for me having to move out of this city to find some level of peace, then that's what I had to do.

Many of them who have finally gotten their places, had to move at least an hour outside of the city, and if they work in the city have to commute. And so just wondering, not only about the affordability, but accessibility, because it's one thing to make it affordable, but then it's those folks who are not in the city, who are swiping those up and we are left with what's leftover. So just making sure that those who are from here who are looking to stay here have that accessibility to affordable housing that's livable and even just the idea of homeowning and what's needed, the education that needs to go in, early on, because things are not really brought up until you start talking about it. We talk to our young people, our youth about being financially intelligent and knowing how to set up their finances, but we also don't know what it takes to apply for a mortgage?

I've had a ton of career just roadblocks because I'm a woman or because I'm Asian or because there's a misunderstanding about my level of education or knowledge. So there's all of these little roadblocks within individual experience that we don't address and when you keep telling people that you work hard, you'll get there. But it really depends on what industry you're in. When I worked in tech, it was insane to me that they were paying me so much just for an assistant level position whereas when I was doing something that I loved in design, I was making less than all of my peers. So no matter how hard I worked or how much further along, I move through moved up in whatever industry is like that, trying to close that gap was an uphill battle. It makes me frustrated, because it's not a lack of trying hard that people are struggling, it's not because people are lazy or because they're not educated. I know plenty of people who work in Starbucks and they have a PhD. So it really how do we want to address it because people do want to work and they do want to contribute and have legacy and have impact, but there are so many gatekeepers.

And I think that this is a extremely pressing issue, just because I think there's this attraction to Boston from top talent, for our top universities, for medical care for these hospitals that young doctors want to work at. All of these great, like high-end resources that are attracting outside talent, when there's also that talent within Boston. I think there needs to be more of an effort to provide those resources to people who are from Boston and willing to put in the work, because there are students in Boston Public Schools, in the Boston Metro Area that are willing to do that.

Nubian Square, seeing how those aren't just titles, but it does represent something and it does express something culturally. So I do understand that that is powerful, especially fighting against things like gentrification. So I'm wondering what that would look like. And the other one was real inclusion in policymaking.

And then, as Dorothy had said, they tend to... When you come up with an issue with the house and the quick build of that, money rules the factor of giving these contractors the job to do something, and then they use cheap materials and product. And I don't know if the inspection process part of it is skipped over just to get pushed along just to get the home sold. And then the City's not tentative to the homeowners when they get into a serious situation. And then the reason why you go through that is because of, like what Tarazer said, the pricing, the pay that you make. Half a million dollars for a property that's probably not equal to a half a million dollars' worth of property.

It's okay that we share, but be fair.

I mean, I was real mad and angry, even though I was a leader of the Brookline Tenant Union, coordinated the entire towns' election and all the 20 precincts, and I just felt powerless and just left and contested. Anyway, a couple of years later, in '95 or '96, I was renting in Jamaica Plain, and a friend of mine [Chrissolio] who had become a realtor, who I knew from years ago, told me about this first-time home buyers program that the city ran. That if you went to this class downtown you could get a $2,000 grant or loan that would turn into a grant from the city to buy a home if you were a first-time home buyer. And it was for low-income people, which I wasn't making a lot of money at the time so I qualified. And so, I went through this, got the thing, and I found an apartment, 94 Forest Hills Street, in Jamaica Plain, for $72,000 and was able to buy it through this first-time home buyers thing. I got a grant, I got a special, soft second mortgage through the Mass Affordable Housing Alliance and bought this place. And I lived there for several years. Later, Jessica and I got married, we moved to Arlington, I still own it. That apartment, it's your basic triple decker, tens of thousands of other triple deckers, not the whole building, just one floor, a thousand square feet, two bedrooms and a front room is now assessed by the city at about $500,000. I mean, that's crazy to me. So, how can anyone... I mean, I could never buy that house now, even though I make good money. And my daughter who moved to Phil... She's 48, bought a house in Philadelphia for 200 and something thousand dollars, could never, even though she makes a lot of money with her partner. So, that's my question. And that's my story. I mean, I was able to do it because I'm old, I'm 74, in '95/'96 I could buy this place with 72,000 and maybe by inflation, it might be 150 if normal inflation would take place, but it's 500.

Now, that's not really going to help a lot of people in the long run, but it provided the developers with an excuse who I erect here in my part of towns, literally hundreds of high rises, which is going to have a completely disastrous effect in terms of climate change issues in the near future, and the delivery of city services, including water and sewer, electric service is going to be deteriorated because every source has already said they don't want to provide more equipment.

But the problem with the housing issue that both of us faced is really the same that Boston does not have a lot of housing stock and the housing stock they're building is not going to help, because it doesn't serve families, and children, especially, these high rises are very dangerous for children. There's nowhere for them to play and so forth, so the housing issue still is critical to many groups of people whether they're homeowners or tenants, whether they're young, or old, or retired, or students, we all are vying for the same piece of the pie here. And the pie is very small to begin with, because this is a small town and this is the problem. Boston has always been a small town and we've always been somewhat in denial about it. And the problem now is, is because the other issue involving construction has reduced the amount of green space. I didn't bring that up, which also is going to contribute to the adverse effects of climate change, because we have fewer trees here, we have a heat sink here in Allston because of the amount of concrete it's going to raise the temperature, that's going to use more electricity, more energy. So, we're making it worse, and at the same time, we're looking at thousands of students pouring back into the city in another few weeks and they're going to be looking for housing. And I think, I personally believe that the rents should come down, and I know their arguments against that. I had a rent controlled apartment, it worked fine for many years. I don't think people understood the law actually, which is why they voted it out. But I think that someone's got to give, it's one of those things where everybody's pulling in the same direction, somebody's got to give a little bit up here in this equation.

This gets into politics, and voting, that's another issue I wanted to talk about, but the problem here is that I walked through Brighton every day on my way to work and home after home is no longer a single-owner home. They're all apartments, they're all, not that many condos, they're all rentals. And so, as a result of this, there is no voter base in this part of town. And that's a serious issue, because these people are running for office who's going to vote for them? Nobody around here, that's a problem. That's a serious problem.

As we approached this upcoming election, the preliminary election, on September 14th and the general on November 2nd, oftentimes our elected officials or candidates will promise us the world and when they get in office they forget, and particularly with the black community. And I'll be very specific African-Americans. They are often overlooked, they're often disrespected in the City of Boston, and I'll go back to what I originally said, in particularly, black men. And we have an opportunity with the upcoming election and with the upcoming vote on a commission for black men and black boys to stop to help change the city's, response to my question, ignoring and mistreating, and for them to even ponder over it would be a problem.

You see all this self-congratulation, for example, about the burst, even the census released his first batch of numbers, which ignores the fact that Boston's black population has decreased. And so, what happens is we get all kinds of rhetorical play, but when it comes to matters of substance, be it broad policy, or be it something as basic as rat control, we will essentially considered to be expendable, and I stress it, even when these requests come from organized groups, the city feels that there's no downsize to ignoring it. Even when the complaints come to district elected officials, be they on the council, or be they in the State House about events in their district, I get the feeling that everything is performative.

But it did tend to encourage longer-term tenancies, which was good thing, and also people tended, I think, to do their own, I certainly did, their own repairs and their own take care... They had more sense of responsibility in terms of the unit. And now, there's no sense of responsibility. It's like a hotel room, essentially. That's what I see from the transients and younger tenants, they have no investment whatsoever. It's like a hotel room to them, a nine month hotel room.

So what would it, I don't know how to even phrase the question, is part of not going into the personal story because it's too painful to talk about it again, and part of the reason I asked that is, the whole theory behind this is hearing personal stories, as opposed to general statements is what's going to hopefully motivate people and connect people.

When I talk about my story, it's painful, it's like reliving trauma. I talk about the times being spit on by drunken white boys and go on to Cub Scout when I was nine years old. That's painful to talk about, because I could still smell the liquor in the spit, which has a bad smell. I mean, I talk about being a young kid growing up in Mission Hill running a major community center and was initiated with Charles Stuart murder when a pregnant white woman was alleged killed by a black man, and those are all a hunt for every black men, civil rights savagely violated, pants pulled down in front of the center, I was going to become the director, couldn't happen to me. That's painful, so I can go on and on. One of the officials in that year, when we started dunk the boat doing a couple of years later in 1992, one of the officials was my brother who was murdered on Christmas Day in 1992. So, when you talk about stories, and then you're asking people to come tell this story, that brings knowledge to those who are collecting it and look at us as being experiments. So, I think it's important that we compensate when we talk about equity, when we talk about reaching people that have been overlooked, mistreated, literally written off, and then you're asking them to relive that experience, it's painful. So, that's why I was hesitant. And you're going to hear many stories like that, and it is traumatic to go through this. I'm sitting here with people that I love, I'm sitting here with people that I trust, but it's still painful to even talk about what I'm experiencing. So, that's why I was hesitant in telling that story. So, as I continue with this project, and as I talked to my staff and those that are part of this campaign, take into consideration that people are dealing with a lot of stuff, whether it's health, whether it's poverty, and whether they feel comfortable being able to tell this story. The people that don't look like them, that they don't trust, that they don't want to tell their business, that they don't want to hear from them how to be black, and what we need.

And if any of these mayors or government officials are smart, they should start listening. From the middle school child up into the seniors that are also being ignored. So, that's my two cents.

And certainly when there are much bigger differences, including the color of your skin and the way you speak and how much your parents were able to invest in your education, I mean, reading you stories when you were an infant or even in the womb or whatever.

So I'm seeing the differences especially when you compare private to BPS and charter, but even with charter and BPS, there's just a lot of differences with the education. It's tough for you want to give the best opportunity to all of your kids or nieces, nephews, everyone around you. Everyone deserves a shot and sometimes it's not fair how things just will happen the way it does and it's really out of your control. But those subtle differences, it has an impact and you just hope that they can do the best with what they have and still make it through."}, {"x": 7, "y": 11, "x_trans": 674, "y_trans": 617, "cluster": 10, "id": 5244537, "words": "I had enough drive to know, okay, once I'm finished, I want to go off to college.

They paved the road, so I was able to see and say okay, now this is what I want to do. Obviously, when I was at Madison, I was not your A student, but I ended up going to Northeastern through it's a program called the Ujima Program. Not sure if it's around anymore. I was not prepared for that school. I didn't have the grades to go to that school. Financially, I couldn't afford it but through programs like that, they gave me the opportunity. I had one year to prove to myself and to the professors that I could, that I belonged there and that was my stepping stone. And then after my first year and just saying okay, you know what I got this then I was able to continue.

I had 15, 10 reasons like really straight up and I've seen these powerful women.

And that's what I did and I was able to get into a school in Chestnut Hill, Beaver Country Day School. And I spent six till 12 grade there. So my experiences are very different, but I know being one of five kids who went to that school, who were actually from Boston, that it's not easy. The experiences I had going to that school really molded me because it's kind of like I had an inside view into what private schools are like and what kids who have the resources from their parents and just their communities look at what they have to do versus us who have to pretty much prove ourselves constantly and fight for everything that we want to be able to stay within the conversation.

But even within those resources and those programs that are available, they are limited. So from my three kids, the oldest got accepted, the other two didn't make it. So okay, you have to take a different path. One of my concerns now looking at colleges, so you have your UMass Boston Amherst etcetera. Before, those were safety schools. You didn't make it into one of those, you got into the one at UMass. Now, it's not a safety school anymore. It's difficult to get into any one of them. So my question now is, what do they fall back on? It's difficult to get into some of the limited programs and if you don't get into those then what? But let's say you make it through the high school, okay, but if you're not in the Ivy League's and you don't get into those competitive school, then what? It just seems like there's always another roadblock and it seems to be affecting certain population and maybe less impacting others. So that's a concern that I see growing as we progress.

I feel like I lived in another land, another country. Okay? In order for me to even be able to go across the street, I need transportation to go across the street from my house. People, family are not readily accessible like they were before the pandemic. Since the pandemic, I do not get on the buses. I do not get on the trains. I just do not ride public transportation because it's kind of, sort of a scary thing, a scary thing. It was scary before the pandemic and pandemic kind of sort of like made an awareness of really just how nasty the environment was. So I don't ride public transportation anymore. Then schools got shut down. The children couldn't go to school. The children couldn't go out to play. The children were locked up in the house with no really kind of curriculum or whatever. And now like everything hasn't completely gone away. That one day, they're saying, send the kids to school. The next day they're saying, take the kids away from the school. So I'm wondering what is my grandchildren's future really going to look like as far as their academics. Then with the housing crisis and stuff going on, I'm wondering, are we going to eventually see more tent cities going up in our cities and our nation because of the housing crisis and because of the eviction moratorium, where they're evicting people because you can't pay your rent. If you can't pay your rent, a lot of people are in danger of, and maybe going to end up homeless.

It ain't have to be on all these main roads where these bicycles, they're not respecting the road, I think, and they should be trained. They should have a license the same we do.

Like for instance, everybody knows, well not everybody knows, but it's a common statistic that everyone always talks about, how the average net worth of Black people is $8, versus white people, which is $247,500. That statistic has remained for, I want to say, almost a decade, for years. That's very problematic to me. The reason why it's very gentrification and red-lining in the history of economic inequity to Black people, I hold that very dear to my heart. I don't really talk about this experience a lot, but I've experienced homelessness, when I was in the 3rd or 4th grade. I'm going to read a piece. It's not too long. I wrote this freshman year of high school and it's called \"Home, Bittersweet Home.\" This is just a piece. We walked back from school and down the street from our home, we seen a moving truck that took us for a surprise. \"Are we moving?\" My little sister asked. That was our initial thought, but as we got closer and closer to the house, we can hear the distressed crying, screaming voice of my mother, grandparents and neighbors. When we arrived, absolutely everything, all of our belongings were thrown out, broken and laid out all over the front lawn. Strangers were throwing pieces of me out of my home. I watched as they threw my baby pictures in frames from my window room. My favorite baby doll was tossed out and falling to sudden death on the concrete. Cracked TV screens laid out on the lawn, pieces of our bedsets, now were outside with worms and bugs crawling all over it. No bed, meant no place to sleep. The refrigerator laid open on the ground, while flies swarmed all around it. My stomach ached all day from hunger, but no refrigerator, meant no food. No baby pictures, meant no more memories. Now, no house meant no home. I tried to be strong, but emotions flooded my brain and tears burst through the walls of my eyelids. Screams of my mother rang throughout the neighborhood, \"You cannot do this. These are my kids.\" With her only belonging left in her hand, her camera, she recorded this whole scene of trauma, along with my grandparents and neighbors, who were also recording and protesting the same. I sobbed while squeezing my sisters and brothers together in a group hug, hoping they wouldn't get to see as much as me. Their tears floods my shirt and weeping cries muffled and echoed upon my chest. Losing everything but the love that we had for each other and with nothing but the clothes on our backs, we returned back to our only shelter that we had now, the car. We did not know where we would go next. We sat in the car waiting for my mom and grandparents to drive off, not knowing where our next stop would be, but definitely knowing it was our last stop here. So that is my experience with homelessness and it's not something I talk about a lot, but that is why this is such a pressing concern, that I hold dear to my heart. Once again, let me repeat the question is, what are we going to do about gentrification? What is the City of Boston doing to close the inequity gap, to stop this economic violence that's been happening to our people? So, that's my question."}, {"x": 8, "y": 12, "x_trans": 837, "y_trans": 697, "cluster": 15, "id": 5242866, "words": "So I guess like that's the question is like, will there truly be a dedication to the art scene and community and the uplift therein?"}, {"x": 8, "y": 11, "x_trans": 791, "y_trans": 582, "cluster": 8, "id": 5242867, "words": "I ask this question, because as a young person, kind of like navigating through the artistic scene in the city, it's always been a difficult situation, figuring out different ways to get my peers involved in different opportunities to receive funding for their art, to you know what I mean? Be able to book venues for our art, if it's like performing art or even just like galleries, just be able to showcase visual arts. It's always been difficult. More recently, we've had to and I'll talk about my experience. I've had to continue to book my own shows out of Boston and I mean because the surrounding cities are so much more accepting of, you know what I mean, the types of art that we create. Also, just like the types of artists that we are, whether that's like hip hop, or R & B, or whatever it is, it's also just recognizing the value of young people and the art that we're creating. So I'm doing shows in Worcester, we're doing shows in Cambridge. You know what I mean? Anywhere that's not Boston and it's so weird because, this is where I'm from. This is where I live. This is where I grew up. So I feel like it's definitely tragic, knowing that the people, or like the places, I guess I should say. Not necessarily the people. But the place where I'm from, doesn't necessarily value or accept the art that we're creating, until it's like commodifiable. I feel like that's the key and that's the difficulty. Even like thinking about funding, I know that for me, receiving funding for my art has never necessarily been like an issue, per se. I also know that now it's becoming more of an issue, based on the types of art that I'm willing to create. You know what I mean? So when you seek and you reach out, when you seek funding, you reach out to different foundations, or organizations, you know what I mean, that are like claiming that they put this value on the artist and the creative scene, but then turn around and the art that you're creating isn't necessarily what they're looking for. Or it's like held to kind of like they understand what you're doing, but it's not necessarily what they're looking for, it's not what they want from you. Or it's too explicit, or it's too kind of like your bleeps are shining through a little too much, it becomes a problem. Then they don't necessarily want to fund you anymore. So it's interesting that kind of like that dichotomy there between what you want to create and what they'll almost allow you to create. So it's difficult, for sure. I think as the scene continues to develop and more and more artists continue to work to create and share their voices, it'll be a lot harder to ignore what we have to say. I just also know that regardless of that, there's still people in power that are going to be kind of like having an influence on that. So that's my question for the city is like, how will, you know what I mean? Will there truly be a dedication to the art scene like you said, or will it kind of just continue to be the way that it's been so far? Yeah. Yeah."}, {"x": 8, "y": 13, "x_trans": 803, "y_trans": 766, "cluster": 15, "id": 5242868, "words": "So one question that comes to mind for me is, when I think of the future of Boston is, will Boston support us all equitably?"}, {"x": 9, "y": 12, "x_trans": 890, "y_trans": 683, "cluster": 1, "id": 5242864, "words": "One pressing concern I have in the City of Boston, especially impacting Black and brown people, is gentrification."}, {"x": 6, "y": 11, "x_trans": 595, "y_trans": 626, "cluster": 5, "id": 5242861, "words": "I don't know, if I may, because I'm not going to be on here much and I'm not really a youth voice, but I think that I can say something that might stimulate some thought, just in alignment with the work that we do, in a sense that, like how is the sort of like City of Boston, like leadership I would say, in Boston going to really make resourceful deposits into young people and their future, that will create an all-inclusive and a transformative future for Boston?"}, {"x": 6, "y": 11, "x_trans": 588, "y_trans": 602, "cluster": 5, "id": 5242862, "words": "So what I mean by that is that, a lot of times, we're operating in the here and now, when the truth of the matter is, the reason why systems actually stay the same, is because the truth of the matter is that, there are two separate levels of cultivation in those systems in the here and now. What I mean by that is that, there are young people being groomed to be workers, or not connected and then others being groomed to lead, with the same status quo, right, and the same mentality of those who lead in the here and now. The truth of the matter is that I think that what young people collectively across the board, not just BIPOC young people, have been pushing on is, how are we creating systems that are equitable, that allow for all of their peers and their friends and the people that they care for and love and have access to, is a part of the future, a part of a positive and productive and thriving future of the City of Boston? So there's other things that I could talk about, but I think that if I tie this question into the work that we're trying to do here at Teen Empowerment, is really try to prepare young people who engage us in a way that they are equipped with the skills and the knowledge necessary for them to be leaders in the City of Boston, that will transform how these systems operate."}, {"x": 8, "y": 11, "x_trans": 788, "y_trans": 579, "cluster": 8, "id": 5242863, "words": "The reason why I think about that is, I connect it to myself as when I was a young person in this city and very disconnected from resources and opportunities and really felt like, I remember going places like downtown Boston, or Back Bay and seeing even men and women who looked like me, going into these big buildings and feeling like those opportunities are so far away from, like I could never be out. Like, I'd never go in that building, like I'll never be able to, I didn't even know what you needed to do, or the skills you needed to have, in order to even have access, or be someone who could be an employee in those spaces. So it felt like I was from a whole different world and I know there are young people, even though there's more information out there now, because of media and so on and so forth. But I think that there are swaths of young people who still feel like, there are places and spaces in the City of Boston, as tight knit as we are and as small as we are, quite frankly, that they just don't still belong. I think that that's one of the problems that we need to really address and we're going to transform how this city looks and how people feel welcome into this city, how they view this city as being a place of equal opportunity."}, {"x": 7, "y": 10, "x_trans": 697, "y_trans": 511, "cluster": 17, "id": 5242869, "words": "I mean I don't think there was like a personal experience, per se, because it's just like two different worlds.

I don't receive that same reality, if I'm in my community where people look like me. So of course, that's a difference. But just in the environment, like going to a public school out there, the quality of the computers, everything about it, looked fairly different when I went into a BPS school, where all of the kids looked like me. You could just see it. It's evident. So that's why I say, it's not really something, people walking and not seeing the difference, is you turning a blind eye to it.

I would really look back on my time at Bunker Hill as being like, I kind of went in there with an attitude, like a chip on my shoulder, that, \"Oh, I'm not supposed to be here. I went to BLA.

I worked at a sneaker store that doesn't exist anymore, called Expressions in Downtown Crossing. You might see locations of that in various neighborhoods in Boston and also in Rhode Island. I worked at Whole Foods before the Amazon acquisition. Thought it was the best thing ever, even though it was $11 an hour. I just worked at grocery stores, sneaker stores, restaurants. All these sort of pieces of labor here and there kind of thing and would really have benefited from just a stronger sort of just some sort of labor introduction, getting people understanding what the workforce is like and being realistic, if you can't make it into college, in this traditional path, or in this certain path, here are some things that you can do and here's somebody to work with.

As I mentioned, I'm driving my family around all the time, which includes my 90-year-old father who grew up in Boston. And I've been doing a lot on Zoom, various things. So there are three parts of that that I wanted bring up in the experience. So last year I did some program at the Mass Historical Society on voting during a pandemic. And in the middle of that, one of the things in that is they talked about how James Michael Curley, if anybody's been in by Faneuil Hall, you see the statue of him, how James Michael Curley and Honey Fitzgerald, who was mayor of Boston and the grandfather of John F. Kennedy, had this real fight and they actually changed the law at that point. So James Michael Curley, who was mayor of Boston, could not have consecutive term. I thought that was hysterical. My father's a history buff and so I talked to him about that while I was driving him over to his appointment, I don't know, over there. Please don't even ask me which hospital it was at that point. And oh, and he said, \"Oh yeah, my father used to work on James Michael Curley's campaigns.\" And I'm like, \"What?\" I was completely amazed. And he told me the story about my great-uncle was at a Curley rally and Curley pointed to him and said, \"You, Kid, you look cold.\" And he gave him the coat off his back. And so that coat stuck around the family for years. We later found out, when I looked into this whole thing, that he actually used to keep coats in his car, so every rally he would do, he would take his coat off and give it to some kid in the group. But anyway, it turned my family into like standout campaigns and everything like that. About the same time I drove my father over to his appointment and we're coming back through Mission Hill, and he's pointing out where his grandparents had lived before they moved to Roxbury. And then he kind of muttered off his oldest brother who was kind of the black sheep of the family, he said, \"Jimmy never left Mission Hill.\" So I started thinking about those things and there were a number of other things. It's like my father, when they were doing busing, the early meetings on busing, we were in the public school and the reason my parents actually took us out of the public school was because my father went to every meeting, and he kept telling people that this tract of area, that they had no houses on, the map they were living that they had was... His house was in the middle of it and he had six kids. And they kept saying, \"We'll figure it out when the time comes.\" And his whole attitude was, \"Well, we're not going to figure it out. I'm going to know what to do with my kids.\""}, {"x": 7, "y": 11, "x_trans": 745, "y_trans": 596, "cluster": 5, "id": 4525350, "words": "Anyway, all of those things kind of boiled up and with the volunteering that I do and everything like that, my question really becomes in some ways, I'm on my way out.

It's how do we set Boston up to the future and honor its past? Because I think we hear way too much of this and history keeps stopping at various places. One of the other things is my father went to Roxbury Memorial for boys, which then became Boston Tech, and when Boston Tech became the O'Bryant, he moved over. Roxbury Memorial for Boys and Girls became Boston Latin Academy. And the president of his senior class is actually the last living member of Martin Luther King's fraternity. He's an activist named Herman Hermanson. He also met a young Edward Brooke working in the library over there, who was the first black senator elected since reconstruction, so he became a friend of his while he was in high school.

And sometimes I feel it's who you know in terms of getting the resources that people need because they're not advertised as much as I think they should be. For me, I was once, and in certain areas I still am a recipient of various resources that the city has to offer, whether it's help with a bill, whether it's food networks, just whatever I need in my life, I know how to get it. A lot of people don't, which is a lot of the reasoning behind my advocating for people that need assistance with certain things. I think it should be advertised, the resources in Boston. And I'm not sure if but Boston has resources for some of everything that everyone could ever need. You just don't hear about them. And again, sometimes it's who you know, what agency you know, who you know that got this assistance before. But I think they should advertise more in the media, television, radio, newspaper, via Zoom, text people, put it on Facebook, wherever they can, so that people can get wind of what's available so that when they are in a bind and need things, they know how to get it. And a lot of people live behind the stigma of needing things and being needy. And that's valid. It's just the makeup of a person, you don't want people to know your business. But if you know where to get it without putting it out there to the world so people won't know your business, then I think it would be better for everyone to get what they need.

They're just so... I would say slumlords if they were our landlords, but I don't call them landlords because they're a management company, but they're the worst. They're so unprofessional. They can't keep a maintenance team together for two seconds. It's just a mess. And I often think, \"If I owned my home or co-owned my home, we wouldn't have to deal with waiting for this or them coming to do this or that.\" And I'll admit, I've been a section eight recipient since 1974, 1972 actually, when I moved out from my mom's home. And I've been able to maintain that, thank God, and live in Boston. Of course, the rents are just through the roof, as you all know, but home-ownership, I've been thinking about it lately, Carmen, and I have a son-in-law that he was a vet. I mean, he fought in the army and now he works for the state, and I've just been saying, \"Buy something so that we can co-own. Buy a home or have it built and build me a little, how they call it, the in-law home, or in-law unit next to it or near it. And that way you can receive the rent that I pay, the rent that the state, this year, that they pay as well.\" But he's, for some reason, not wanting to do that. But just home-ownership would be so great because you have so much more of a say so in making your home as comfortable as you want it, instead of having to wait and go through the headache of people that aren't doing what they're supposed to do. So I live here right in Dorchester, and I've always thought home-ownership should be out in the suburbs somewhere. But no, I'd love to own a home right here somewhere in Dorchester, because I lived in Dorchester, Mattapan, since I've been in Boston, and I just love it. I don't always love what's going on outside of my door, but I love Dorchester, I really do. And I'd like to own a home here and the homes that they have here just cost so much. I don't foresee that happening, but I'm onboard with you, Carmen. I'd love to be a homeowner. I think we all should be homeowners if we could, but I know that's not... Probably not possible for everyone. But yeah, that really resonated with me."}, {"x": 10, "y": 12, "x_trans": 1021, "y_trans": 673, "cluster": 2, "id": 5245338, "words": "Yeah, I'll go next. And unfortunately, I'm going in three different ways right now. I did drop something in the chat because, which anybody can read it, I've been thinking a lot about it and about all of the people who negotiate this world or this city or whatever, in more than one language, like Andry. And I find it kind of irritating that it's not celebrated because it is such an amazing accomplishment. And I've taken language classes and I keep telling people I struggle with English, but I think it's amazing and it upsets me that it is not celebrated, it is not considered one of the great benefits of Boston. So that was one way. I do own a home. I find it kind of interesting when people say, \"Oh, I never thought about owning a home,\" or anything like that because I own a home. I would not be able to buy it now, which that will be the next point, I will follow up on that. I would not be able to, like that, it's falling apart. I need help to do it, but there are some issues. I would like to say there is something called NACA, naca.com, which is a low income... Helps low income, low and middle income people buy houses. So just, people can look at that. We're smart and interestingly, we were able to buy the house way back when, under its previous incarnation, so I know about them. But going back to that kind of idea that I never thought... I know people choose to rent as opposed to buying houses, but that was always the default for me, is to buy a house. So I find that kind of interesting. And as I said, I would never be able to buy it now. I refer to this as I was kicked off the socioeconomic ladder. And I use the word kicked off very clearly. So when people start talking about accessing resources and everything like that and advertising, I didn't know that it was a big divide. And it's a communication divide. And somebody actually said to me, she said, \"My parents, my mother was a single mother on welfare.\" And we were having this conversation, there's a lot to this, so nobody get offended if this comes out wrong, because it was a long conversation that went with this. And she said, \"I can't imagine what it's like for you to not even understand how to apply for these things.\" I've got the college degree, I've got the whole thing like that, but it's a completely different language. And I don't think people understand how completely different the language is and the understanding is. And I said to a friend of mine who I had known beforehand, but she had gone through struggles and everything like that.

So it was one of those things that she was the pathfinder for me. And you don't think about the fact that there is a completely different language there too. Anyway, anybody have any questions they can ask me because I don't know if I'm explaining this well, but as Miss Cynthia talks about, I want to get information out to people and things like that. There's this whole group that doesn't even understand these concepts.

Other people it's literally getting the permanent place, or Miss Cynthia actually talked about her son-in-law buying a place and that would create the home, but it would create a financial stability within the extended family.

We need to be secure. And what we get we need to be able to keep it. We need to have something that can't be taken away from us. Like, if we get housing and we buy these houses in the community, I'm concerned about somebody coming in and offering somebody three or four times what their house is worth so that they can blockbust the community. And pretty much like Priscilla was saying with gentrification, when they want it they just come back and take it. We need some protection against that. And, the equality part of that is that it needs to be in the communities of color. Like I said, I live in what's called the West End. It's right next to North End with the Italians. Their equity is passed down through their families, their generations. They keep theirs. So, I worked at Unity Bank back in the day in the 70s and I watched money flowing through Boston.

We're not educating our young people to say, okay, we don't need those Jordan sneakers, we don't need this that and the other, we need stuff that we're going to be able to pass down to generations. We're going to leave a legacy. So, that's with my issue. That's my experience that has led me to this. I'd watched people just lose everything, and get pushed out. That's my experience.

They come in our communities, they campaign, and they promise stuff. We don't see the changes. They know what we need. It's not like they don't know what we need. I'll give you a perfect example. Mass Cass. Now, we have this city that is spreading. It's spreading almost like a disease on your skin. You know what I mean? They saw this coming. They've seen it in other cities, and they knew when there was I think 25 tents down there. They saw that. They knew it. They didn't address it. They said they knew there was a problem and they were going to create committees to explore, and they have all these different phrases and things that they use when they want to back you up off of them. So, there's over 200 now. There's a rat infestation there. The community down that way cannot continue to operate. The food pantry is down there. The big food pantry for Boston is down there. It's unsafe. You have people down there who are mentally ill. They're not responsible. So, people seen this coming. I've heard so much [inaudible] about it. Everybody has their take on it but nobody's doing anything about it. Now, and even with the ones that are running for mayor, it comes up in every conversation just about. They knew that it was there. These people didn't just fall off the chicken truck. They have been in the position to do something about that all the time. They have been in political positions, all of them, and especially these two that are running. So they knew. So when Oanh was talking about holding people accountable to their promises, we don't want to just hear you say what we want to hear at the time and get our votes. My vote is very important. I came from the generation where I heard about the stories about them closing down the polls. My mother and my aunts and uncles and all of them, it wasn't safe. They would burn down your house and kill your whole family. Lynch you in public so that it would deter the other people from stepping up and wanting to vote or wanting to be an advocate for voting. So, my vote is very important. We do need to hold these people accountable. When we don't see something being done when there's a promise that you made, and this is an age old issue. So, yeah, I relate to Oanh and what she said, and thank you."}, {"x": 8, "y": 7, "x_trans": 770, "y_trans": 244, "cluster": 11, "id": 5245314, "words": "Hi, I think in a way I actually can relate to pretty much everybody in the group as well, because these are the conversations that I have heard in the past so many times when I go out and work in the community. And you listen to each individual person's experience and they share their hearts out and they share important issues that is dear to their hearts or really close to each and every single community. And, that's what motivates them to keep wanting to work with certain political candidates or political leaders, hoping to make a change. Hoping that they can hear our voices, and hoping to see things happen instead of seeing all of that is just like empty promises and the feeling of being used. And I think, at the end of the day that's the feeling that we would hate to have, is the feeling of being manipulated by someone, or being used for their own personal agenda, versus, trying to identify the real problems and coming up with real solutions. And I think that's where we can all relate. Doesn't matter what our background is. Doesn't matter what our nationality is, is just that mentality of, hey, these are real problems that we're facing on a daily basis here, and you guys all came from the same background that we came from, so what makes you think that you're better than us. And once we actually elect you in office, instead of working for us, you're working against us, and you're making yourself being more powerful and living this virtual life versus being able to connect, have that real connection to the people that voted for them.

So, it's really hard to have that across sector collaboration to ensure that would be across the board, because we know that we all have scarce resourcing and we all try to fight for the pie, but not [inaudible] and collaborate, not working together in that context. And then not really involve those who have this experience to be part of that decision making and policy revising or practices that we should be designing as a city or as the officer to be able to do that. So I think a lot of this would be... so if I should go back into the questions, whether or not... how we can hold, that Nan already mentioned, officers accountable in the work that they do? But the big thing for me in terms of how can we ensure that everything is interconnected, and how can we leverage that collaboration, partnership? And a lot of that has to come from cross work community. And I think the bigger thing would be the budget and funding. Budget and funding have not been equitably distributed across all different sectors. Some who might have more of a voice, some who might be able to speak up and speak out, those are the one who always receive the most. However, there's so many different other community day agency or faith-based agency who do the good job who really out in the community and a lot of them also doing from their heart with the husband, but the officers doesn't [inaudible].

I mean, some of these people that are running have been operating like this for years. So we need to let them know that we pay a salary. You're supposed to represent us. And if you continue to operate like this then we are going to remove you. However, we need everybody. We need the blacks. We need the Latinos. We need the Asian. We need the white folks. We need everybody to be saying the same thing to these elected officials because we get it. We know we don't get the services because we don't come out and vote. And that's insane that we continue to ride our bumpy roads, that we continue that we're the last ones getting our trash dump. We can't go through the process of signing up with the City as a vendor for procurement because their process is so long and intimidating that we can't get through it. We don't have organizations that help us with our back office stuff, either be it nonprofit or whether it be a construction worker. We have a lot of construction workers, they have their own businesses, but they don't know how to do the back office stuff. They don't know how to bid on their projects. So they under bid and they don't make any money. I mean, I've seen so much. And I'm telling you, that's what makes me fight and talk the way I do, because I've seen it. I've been in it. And I'm tired of it because it's so unfair. I've been in banking. I worked for the Mass Affordable Housing Alliance helping folks with their first time home buying. Remember when we all got Red Line? I mean, the system continues and continues to beat us down. And who runs the system? White men. Because you have all these white men that are in government that now Washington's been shook up because there's a lot of women coming in, women of color, and that's what we need to do. We need to not only look at the City but we need to look at the state of Massachusetts, because we are getting ready to get a governor next year. There's going to be redistricting, so there's going to be seats up for running. And that's what we need to have. We need to have people that look like us, reflect the synergism and the legislators. Governor Baker doesn't even have a black person on his cabinet. So how are they representing us when he don't even have nobody like us on his cabinet. These are the things that we need to be questioning and then asking them. I asked Michelle Wu, \"Is your cabinet going to look like the people that you serve?\" Because we don't want to go backwards.

My vote don't count.\" And I look and I've been saying, \"Yes, it's good to register, but you need to educate these people.\" Just because you register them, it doesn't mean they're going to vote. You need to register them and then follow them, whichever way. Like MassVOTE is one of them that really gets out to other organizations to help with that and I've been doing phone banking for years and the Get Out The Vote issue. And, we need to hold elected officials accountable. That's how I got a lot of things done in the [A-leagues 01:04:00]. I knew from the governor, except for Baker, all the governors down and the mayors, and even though we only had one for 20 years and then... but anyway, I knew him, and the city councils, right? But, it's a matter of you letting them know you're not going to just sit back and let them do what they want, because I would tell them quick, \"I voted you in, I'll vote you out, or I'll run for your office.\" But, even though I'll never do that. But it's just, I'm serious, we start with our kids now and then, well, we have to start with the older ones. I'm a senior. I live in a senior housing, right? And, I don't think half of the seniors in here are registered to vote. But I know the ones are, it's a strong group. But, we need all of the elders to... Well, we're powerful and everybody know seniors go and vote before anybody else. It's a matter of holding them accountable. And like I'm a lifetime member of the NAACP, and I would go to the conventions, right? And what they do in Washington, they have a report card for everybody in Washington. This is the NAACP national. And I've been saying, \"We need to do that in state, especially Massachusetts.\" We need to see what bills they're passing, which ones they're not supporting, and have a record of that, and have it where it's somewhere online or somewhere that the community could go and look at it and form their own opinions, because I think we need to stop telling people who to vote for. We need to tell them you go do your own research and find out. Don't vote for someone because Sarah said you could vote for them. I heard people say, \"Well, Sarah, don't tell them this because they'll go back and say Sarah told me to do this.\" So, [inaudible]. But that's my opinion. And that's why I really believe in the voter registration, voter education. Like with my kids, when they turned 18, my nieces and nephews, I would do a voter registration event for all of them that turned 18. And I told my kids, \"You better not come back in the house unless you voted.\" So, these are the things we need to do.

What are those other communities doing that's keeping it out of their communities? There's no gun manufacturers in Roxbury. There's no poppy fields in Roxbury, Dorchester.

And the third dot is for business owners. Because it's entirely up to us to identify problems in our every day life.

After having a house, well, it was his daughter, my mother, who actually received the house after he passed away, but she was gentrified out because it became unaffordable for her to live there, because of taxes. Now it's a multimillion dollar home, on the corner of Stromard and Massachusetts Avenue. As I said, five generations of Rocks have lived over and impacted in that house, and unfortunately, it's gone now.

And I'm going to put in people of color, and I'm going to talk about poor Whites too, that their parents jumped and ran and moved out, but some weren't able to move out, and they're still there, and the kids are getting the same lack of educational opportunities. So the real question for me, is housing and education.

And I understand that the city government makes all these ordinances and stuff like that, but to place the blame on the people that are moving in, \"You're taking this away from us,\" if they can afford it, then they can afford it.

And the bottom line is, those that do vote, should actually coil all this together, and have those conversations with the body politicians, to essentially say, \"Guess what? When a developer comes in and wants to develop on public land owned by the city, and they want federal or state, or city tax credits, you don't get them unless we come up with a plan to make sure that there's packages of housing, for one, two, three, four, five room housing.\" Because you know, Black families and Latino families are large. But they're making apartment buildings with one bedrooms and efficiencies, so that automatically forces people out, particularly those that can't afford that market rate housing. So if there's no strategy to make sure that the developers and the city, is requiring a certain number of properties made out for families... But there's not that conversation in the city, at all.

A lot of people were in the room, and they were talking about a framework to be able... A Black agenda, unapologetically Black, not people of color, but a framework that had smart measures that were specific measurable, attainable, and had time sensitive markers.

There's nothing to make them feel like they belong to the city of Boston. We have to fight so how for them. My experience in my life goes back to my three sons. I was a single mother and I was raising three sons, and all I heard all through their lives was statistics, crime. You know they're not going to be this, they are not going to be that. You know people were putting them down, their peer people were putting them down as a young African American child. Schools, Community Centers. Just people that they looked up too. So, that led me to fight for them. To travel with them. To make sure that they're okay. To make sure that they earn and get what they need to get out of Boston as I did for a child that my mother gave me. I wanted them to believe in their selves that they can accomplish anything in life. They could do anything they want in life. Nothing, no word, no action could take place in theirs lives that would stop them. That just made me get more into their education. It made me follow through their education, until I made sure that they were okay to able to stand up and finish the rest of their lives as men. To not be statistics, not go to jail, not do this, not do that. The city of Boston has to understand that it is all about our children. We have lived our lives, we have done everything in our lives, and we have a lot of children here that are suffering and can not get the quality lives that we already had, and it's not fair to them. So, my mission is to fight for our children. My place in Boston in the future, I want to have the biggest organization for the children because they have so much talent, and so much to offer, and I want to be a voice for them. I want to carry their voices on my back, and once we get where we are going I want to take them off my back and put them in front of me and make sure that they are able to talk as loud as they can and accomplish everything they can.

Basically the city should be ashamed of themselves in that we have a big population of the homeless that's in Boston. Now, back in the day, I had a sister that was out there too. It was a long time ago, and a sister is someone that you really love and you really want to do what you can, but you can never understand her situation.

DSA has some technology, has some stuff that they're starting to push for their students, but I would love to see that happen for all of our young black and brown kids in these BPS schools now."}, {"x": 10, "y": 10, "x_trans": 977, "y_trans": 482, "cluster": 6, "id": 5242804, "words": "My question is how can we make our communities a safe and decent place to live for our elderly women and our young boys and girls?"}, {"x": 10, "y": 9, "x_trans": 981, "y_trans": 363, "cluster": 13, "id": 5242805, "words": "And my personal experiences within the last year and a half, I seen the uptick in the violence in the city of Boston has been very concerning to me especially as a father with a young teenage girl and a adolescent boy and seeing two of our elderly grandmothers be shot and killed by stray bullets, just one just this past summer.

And it creates tension in the home because these parents are trying to live vicariously through them. And they yelling at them, being that parent that's yelling from the stands, wanting them to be a certain way. And these kids, their heart is not in it.

I was a part of gangs, I've hurt my community, I didn't understand that I was not competing economically and I was not headed towards helping my brothers and sisters in my community in Roxbury, get where they needed to go by playing small.

No, no, sorry. I'm sorry. Seventh grade was all white women and they were excited to have BAM there and my judgment is because I am a black male. I mean, they struggle with understanding how to teach our young men and I think that's very important.

I've had an opportunity to do music, I had an opportunity to go to college and play for university of Tennessee and once they see me, black and brown young man like themselves, they can relate to that.

I guess they're trying to do privacy and stuff, but 12 years old, there ain't no privacy. When I was 12, I didn't have no privacy, when I was 12, I couldn't go to the doctors and tell the doctors whatever I wanted to tell them and tell my grandmother to sit out in the waiting room. That wasn't happening. So, I feel like us as parents and grandparents, we have to get back to our roots, because when children were raised the way I was raised, I didn't like being told what to do and stuff and like that, but it made me who I am today and that made me a great person, because I had structure. My grandmother played out with us. We would get in trouble for stuff. Discipline was very popular in our household. And now it's like people are telling the people they can't discipline the children anymore. That's making the kids feel like they've got the power. Growing up I didn't have no power. My grandmother told us something and that was it. And then moving forward to the housing, there's no rent control. Every year my rent is going up and I don't understand that, because it just doesn't make sense to me. The people can just keep raising the rent, raising the rent, housing authorities telling you, \"Oh, there's nothing we can do, we're only going to pay you this amount. Or you're going to have to find somewhere else to live.\" And then it's like trying to find somewhere else to live is like pulling teeth out of somebody's head with no Novocaine. It's like my voucher is for this much, people aren't even accepting this price anymore for housing. It's ridiculous. And then as far as the homeless people in the world right now, it's getting cold outside and I really feel for them, because right now it's freezing. And what are we supposed to do. Yes, we're complaining about rent control and housing and stuff. We've got a roof over our head. At the same time, someone else doesn't. And that hurts me, but I still have concerns as a resident also. And as far as April, as far as the people building condos and housing everywhere. That's concerning too, because it's like okay, what are we going to do. We just wait our turn to be pushed out? Or what are they going to tell us? We've got to go? I don't know how that works.

My son is five years old and I went to the school. They had a meeting with me, because he has autism. He was pulling his pants down and urinating on the floor. So, I'm like, \"Okay, that doesn't sound right, because when he's at home he is not doing it, he goes to the bathroom and he wears underwear.\" So, for school I didn't feel comfortable just putting him out in school in underwear so I sent him in pull ups. And they were all like, \"He needs to be in underwear since he wears underwear at home, he should be in underwear at school.\" I was like, \"I don't think that's a good idea.\" Because, I think it's too fast. He is not familiar with his surroundings yet, he doesn't know. But people don't think that we know our children and that we don't know what's best for them, because they have degrees and these things and that they know better than we do, but if we've been with our children ever since they've been born. We know our child more than anyone else can think that they know them. So, I did what they said and I put him in underwear and I sent him to the school. And I set my son up for failure, because then he's in an uncomfortable situation. He doesn't know if this is comfortable for him or not. So, he ended up pulling his pants down and stuff. So, then they ended up wanting to have a meeting with me. So, I ended up having the meeting with them. And then I'm like, \"Let me see what this bathroom looks like, let me see.\" Because, my son has a problem with using public restroom, so I go in the bathroom and I walk into the classroom and the classroom is so depressing. As soon as I went in the class, it was a whole depression came over me or something. It was dark in the class. I forgot where I was at. And I'm like, \"Damn, open up some of the windows, the shades and stuff, why is it so dark in here?\" And so I walked into the bathroom to see if he'll go and the bathroom was so dark and scary. It looked like it was a dungeon or something. I'm like, \"No wonder why these kids is in here acting up, they're in a developmental class and it's depressing as hell in here. Come on. No wonder why they're acting up. Open up the damn shades. Put the light on in the bathroom. God said let there be light, come on. Get it together in here.\" I'm like, \"Oh my god, I didn't even know.\" I felt something as soon as I went in there and I was uncomfortable. And I didn't like that so I took my son home for the day, because as soon as I went back in the room to talk with the teacher and then they said my son was knocking shelves off of the wall. So, I'm like, \"Yeah, you're going home for the rest of the day.\" They were trying to kick him out of school. So now guess what, since I put the pull ups back on and send him to school, now it's okay for him to stay at the school. I don't know. Thank you.

It's like everyone is so sheltered, everyone just stays to themselves. No one is talking to anyone, it's like you see something, say something, it's like everybody is minding their own business. They don't want their kids, even pre pandemic, playing with your kids. It's divided. I don't know if it's just systemic racism, because it's a predominantly Dominican community or whatever, with a couple of blacks, Asians, but it's really sad, because I miss that growing up as a kid, where they say it takes a village to raise a child and everyone looked out for other people's kids and their safety and wellbeing.

It's not like you see a lot of friendly faces anymore, you see people, they're like, \"Ra.\" So, it's like you'll just be scared. People are not really sensitive anymore. A lot of people are just cold and bitter now. I don't know, I remember growing up I've seen a whole bunch of jolly faces, happy people. People were happy. People were content with who they were and they were just, they just loved everyone. My grandmother, she raised us and stuff. And we was in a three family house and stuff on Crawford Street. That's where we grew up at, in Grove Hall. And everybody knew everybody. Everybody just knew everybody and it was good. Now it's like everybody is divided. They don't want to know nobody and that makes you scared. I'm not going to trust somebody with my child that don't look too friendly. So, it's just everybody is divided, everybody is all about self. And then they wonder why these kids are out here shooting each other. These kids are out here getting into all of this stuff, probably because they can't relate to their own people and their own house. They need someone else to talk to. Maybe someone else, if you can't get them on the right track, maybe someone else can. That's how it was. If I couldn't talk to my mom about something, I had my aunt. If I couldn't talk to my aunt about something, I had my other aunt or my uncle, I always had someone I could go to and talk to. And now, it's like I have my own children, I have a 19 year old daughter, I have an 11 year old daughter and I have a five year old son. And I'm paranoid to send them with anyone, because of all the things that happen in the world. You want to trust, you really do, but you don't want your kids to be in a situation that you could've had control over, but you didn't. Because, then they resent you after, \"You put me in the situation.\" So now, it's like electronics is controlling the kids. Any damn way. Electronics. Electronics. Their phones. Their iPad.

It's a human rights issue and if we have all of this room to build million-dollar McMansions in Dorchester and billion-dollar skyscrapers and high-rises that are sitting empty, we definitely have the ability to build more affordable housing. I saw an article yesterday that the BPDA, which is the Boston Planning and Development Association, I think, they approved something like 940 units of housing for the city of Boston. 172 of those units are listed as affordable. And affordable is a misnomer. We have way more people who are living down in... closer to the extremely low income level in this city, who cannot find housing because it is so ridiculous. But housing-affordable goes all the way up to, in some neighborhoods, $120,000 a year. That is insane. A person who is making $20,000 a year cannot compete in the same market as a person who is making $120,000 a year. And so... But both of those people would qualify for affordable housing in Boston, as it is now. And so those two things really...

And so, having spent the last, like I said, spent the last 13 years now, in Boston, I think I could, to a large extent, say I have seen it, but also I have listened to many stories. It resonates with me and I think too, to that point, is that having conversations like this and making sure that folks like Pamela, and many others who have lived here, do not leave here to go to Brockton or go to another place, it's real. And so we need to fight together. It is, whether you are new to Boston or just coming to Boston yesterday, or even arrive in Boston today, the conversation should be ongoing.

All of those African countries are black, but yet if I could take pictures and show it to my folks in Nigeria, they will laugh at me. But anyway, that's a different conversation. So I say that this is a reality, and we have to do that together, irrespective of where we come from. Whether you're old or new, it's a fight that we have to do and I think, like I said, I'm also coming from a spiritual... Today's kind of a day that the Lord has made. But I remember this, just this in regards to the Old Testament, sorry, I'm going to go a little bit fate, where the Bible talks about even those that are poor, the rich, when they go to glean their land, the Bible tells us that they allow, they don't glean everything, they allow for the poor. But we don't see that happen now. What we see is the people who claim everything and the poor doesn't have opportunity to glean behind them. And so when people go to harvest, what I'm saying is that they leave something for the poor. And what we're seeing is that the rich, [inaudible] goes grab everything is that's there. They grab as much as they could. They could even clear everything so the poor doesn't have anything on the street. And that's the result of what we see happen here. And so that's one story that resonates with me. And, like I said, I'm here. Part of the rules, it goes to tie to my own passion of seeing young people, that they don't have to live like their parents. I've got two boys and this is a fight that I have to do for them.

The weather is cold. There's a very long winter in Boston and because of the history of the city.

No, solve is the wrong word. But that what's really going to help native people? And I think everyone's really concerned about climate and the future.

I was reading a lot about gentrification and how these colleges and universities that are here are causing a lot of the problem, because people get big jobs with big salaries and then they stay here and then they cause the cost of rentals to rise. And also, just there's so many students, so the demand is so high. And yeah, all these issues. But for me, my sister, I'm from Pennsylvania, so she lives by Philadelphia and for a very nice new, renovated apartment, Philadelphia is not cheap. I don't know, the prices aren't even comparable to like a little apartment here in Brighton, which is just interesting. And I think that for some, while at the same time, as some colleges and universities, they're causing these issues. But I think that students can afford to live in these situations and pay the prices and that's causing the costs to rise. But I feel like with my PhD stipend, it's very low. And I'm from a low SES family. And my parents can't afford to help me, which I know is happening for some other students in my program. So it's definitely really a struggle just to make ends meet and meet my rent. And when I was choosing programs and comparing them, I was talking to people who live here for a while, like the faculty and students and things like that. And a big thing they said was, \"We can't change it, but this stipend is really hard to live on, especially with the cost of living in Boston, how high it is. And we're not going to lie to you, this is just how it is.\" So, that was something I knew coming in.

And being single, being Asian, first generation, is very. Being a struggle, I move in different towns in Boston. I'm reaching for Brookline and now I'm in Allston. But Brookline, I still consider Brookline and stuff. So that's why I was hesitant to say anything about where I live, because different towns are slightly different. I worked in different towns as a case manager too. So I know how it is working with families [inaudible]. I was a case manager at the DCF and all that. So I had that experience working with them and knowing that, and me now living here, it's totally different, even though it's a town over. So that's why I have many different skills and jobs just to survive, especially on your own, doing it. And just continue doing it and continue education, times change. But it's very difficult and it's yeah, it's very difficult, especially a woman and being minority, they still see that and there's still stereotypes. What you should do, what you shouldn't do and being first generation is very difficult because everyone in my family's married and have kids and I'm single, much later in life than everyone here. Even though I might look young, I have the energy more of younger stuff. I have more energy earlier, it's more a quiet time. Yeah, so it's a very difficult and being disabled somewhat, I can say right now, it's a struggle because I don't get benefits. The disabled person to have stereotype. I have to still work really hard and justify if I do get anything, every year's review. So it's a very hard struggle doing that, on top of you were struggling early trying to make a living here, buying a place on your own and stuff. And not getting much help, being single, is not nice because people have kids, they get all these benefits, right? Everyone's to their own, but for me, being single, you don't get benefits. Now, people get benefits and have kids, right? So they have the extra money and stuff coming in, right? Single ones are the ones you see they're struggling working right now with COVID going because they have to. So it's very difficult and it's unfair really. So hopefully that does change and there's more incentive for being single and being happy being single. You don't have to necessarily be married, or a couple, or anything like that.

And when I grew through the 60s, 70s, and 80s, I can remember smelling burning houses, and I can remember people talking about wetting their roofs so that ember from other houses that were going to be set on fire by people who were never moving back to the neighborhood, and would never sell their property as well, those are the same properties that are now along the Blue Hill half-quarter, all the way from lower Roxbury all the way into Mattapan Square to Milton. So, this has been my experience growing up here in Massachusetts and seeing this, the powers at be, the same structures exist. It's the same story that the queen was talking about, people deciding now that people with color who could only live in Roxbury now can live in Stoughton and Thornton and all these other places, but Roxbury is now the place where they should be.

I met people who are homeless. I'm involved in an organization now that works[inaudible] immigration advocacy. And yes, my personal experience has been I sat in the State Houses when, for example, the bill for driving has come up. I've been in maybe two those hearings and each time you get these super conservative county sheriffs from different areas of Massachusetts, they come in, they say their... yeah, they [inaudible] bigotry in the State House and then the bill never really passes through. I think even as recent in this year, I want to say someone from my own city where I lived many years, I lived in Lynn for most of my time in the U.S., and I met Senator Brandon Creighton many times, and he's someone who has been involved in trying, or more recently, but he's been involved in trying to push for the driving for family legislation, and even from what I can see, the well intention politicians don't get very far here in Massachusetts. And then I guess the other experiences that I've had in terms of just homelessness, it's just, I don't know, it's sad to me just how stratified the socioeconomic situation is in Boston. I mean, it's like night and day. You go to one side of the City and it's just excessive wealth. All these granular stores. And then you go to another side of the city and then you got things like the Methadone Mile and, instead of doing things to actually deal with the mental... and I'm sure there is some, but most of it is not from the government. These are separate organizations that are working to try and heal these populations. But instead you have things like the Boston Police Department doing... I forget the exact name, actually, it came to me, Operation Clean Sweep, things like that. So instead of actually helping these people you're just treating them like criminals. And it's just, yeah, I mean, I guess, that would be my personal experience. I didn't have any personal experience in Boston with the police, but I've had experiences with police in the North Shore area. Like I said, I'm from Lynn. And yeah, I just have... it is sad to realize... I guess something that I've always felt uneasy even before becoming involved in any social activism spaces was just... I mean, just as a minority, and I think many minorities because they went through this, just walking around Boston, for me, I always felt uneasy. It's always very clear that you come to this side of the City and you're not finding your people there, and they don't live there, and the chances are they're going to be very gated either by money or just straight up, what I would say, covert racism, for moving into certain neighborhoods."}, {"x": 9, "y": 11, "x_trans": 917, "y_trans": 592, "cluster": 0, "id": 5242788, "words": "I mean, I think about, the other... and I'll stop after this next statement.

But anyway, my point was going to be that I would work in Western Mass and, or more west of Mass and yeah, there is plenty of land. There is plenty of land in Massachusetts. I worked at a property maybe two weeks ago where a giant house, something like several acres, and it had been abandoned for over a decade, just sitting there. And, do they decide, hey, we're going to build housing here? No, because this was the City of Newton. No, actually, no, it's the city of Needham, which is very similar to Newton, which basically is like, we do not want colored people here. This place is for well off white folk. So, is there no land to build affordable housing? No, there's land. They just don't want to build affordable housing for these groups and it's just...

And I think that there has not been enough help around the Latino community based parts in Boston. And I think with the pandemic we saw that happen a lot. I'm a journalist, and so I was able to talk to a lot of people, and to write about a lot of these things. And I had a really rough time realizing how much this community was ignored. And how if it wasn't in English, they just wouldn't know. There were like... Even information was not available to a lot of people, because he wasn't in Spanish. I've even seen the translations are not even done correctly either. So it's just a bunch of people not even able to realize or understand what was going on. Especially in a time through... For example, when the pandemic it started, it was really hard for people to even know what was happening. And what was the right to do and what was not right to do. And so I felt very much like the community was ignored. And so sometimes I... I guess that's why my question is, is there a future in which communities whose first language is not English, or who struggle with immigration because of how they got here, is there a future for them? And is there space for them? And a lot of them, for example, when it comes to the census, they're to this day terrified to look at it, to answer it, to be like, \"Yes, I'm here.\" So there's not a real statistic on which you can say, there's this many people in East Boston or in Chelsea. Of there's this many Latinos here who are this many. People here with this many families, with this many... You don't fully know because a lot of them will not even open the door.

And it's interesting to me, Sophia, my family is Italian, and we lived in East Boston. Came through East Boston and it's another generation, and I watched the Italians leave East Boston. And I watched a lot of people from Central America and Latino people come in. My grandmother stayed until her death, but the community changed tremendously. And East Boston has always been a portal for immigration since colonization took hold and was begun. And so it's really interesting, and very truly upsetting to hear your question. And it dovetails with my question, in so far as who is here, and what's going on? I feel like the entire city is becoming corporatized. And my great aunt owns the house that I lived in, and she can't afford to be a landlord. She can't afford the taxes, and the water bill, and the...

And I think that the culture of developers that took hold in the last 20 years, is transforming the cities in ways that I don't fully understand what the future of the city will be, and who will be living here. So that's my personal experience also in terms of why I feel that way, and it really does distress me. I guess I'm third generation Bostonian in the immigrant lineage. My daughters have lived her, their whole lives, but they're only 12 and 15. And I don't really foresee that we are going to stay Bostonians, which makes me sad. Because concurrent to that, I went to Boston public schools. I know people at every level of the city in terms of public servants within education, at city hall, friends and family, community members. I'm part of my community here in Dorchester as a mother and a parent. And all of these things have tremendous, this is my life. And so not having seized the opportunity to be a homeowner 25, 30 years ago. I just think was rapidly... it's clear to me it's too late. Unless my income changes significantly, which is not to say that's impossible. But as I balance motherhood, and parental responsibilities, and work, which I share in common with every working pay parent to. To ratchet up income to be able to stay here is less likely, if I'm going to maintain that balance, and do a good job as a parent as well.

I'm currently in a community service club here at Northeastern, and one of the things that we did was a culture walk.

And we went through all different communities of Boston that I've personally not been to before. And something that was kind of eye opening to me was that I didn't, since I've never been to them before, I didn't really know that they were there. And it was kind of like a very reflective experience because I was wondering why I haven't been to those communities before and why this club that I was participating in thought we would benefit from these walks. And I realized that it is so important to familiarize yourself with the communities that surround you. Especially since the Northeastern campus is kind of, it can be kind of isolating if you don't walk beyond the borders of it, it can feel like its own little isolated place where everything is all students, and all... this one type of community and culture and academic rigor. But you walk just like 10 minutes outside of the campus lines and there's a whole different community and culture at play. So that was something that was very eye-opening to me. And I think that's why I came to that question, because even though I did engage in those neighborhood and community walks, I still want to learn more about it. And I still want to be confident in my familiarity with those communities. And I want to be able to hopefully one day see myself as a part of that community too. Because I would much rather be a part of a community than simply live in a community. And I feel like there's a very big difference with that.

But if you start in the city where you live, there are social centers, for example, community centers, the school where your kids go, they have potlucks, they have open houses.

We come from different places, but I think we all share the same goals. We... as a mother, in fact, you meet with mothers and they all want what's good for their kids. They want their kids to go, to be good at school, to be involved in afterschool programs. So because of that, you start making friends and the friends are not always, and not in my case, they were never from my countries. They were people who came to the United States or people from Boston. And then you start, this friendship would last forever. I'm still friend with parents whose kids went to with my sons when they were in elementary school. My kid is in college now.

There are some people that involve themselves in things, and it takes awhile. Sometimes suddenly you're listening to the opinions and the ideas of other people, and they're just not... you just, just work on yourself. Go inward, work on yourself, work on your intuition. And if your gut, always go with your gut, if your gut tells you, \"Wait a minute, that didn't sound right. That person didn't sound like they were really supportive of my ideas.\" And what I found is, any idea you have that comes from within you, any goal that you set as something that you want to do, you don't let anybody else interfere with that. When people come home, have opinions and want to interfere, you sometimes have to cast that aside, because everyone's different. And we all have an innate ability to preserve ourselves and to reach our goals, especially if those goals are toward the betterment of humanity and the betterment of ourselves, and the betterment of pretty much the universe. So that's my idea and my belief that I've learned through the years, that sometimes you just have to stay to your course. Stay the course no matter how many naysayers are out there. If you know that what you're trying to do is something that's going to be beneficial to yourself and beneficial to Boston on the whole, don't let people deter you. Just fearlessly forge ahead. There'll be times when you'll have to move slow. There'll be times when you'll have to stop and rest.

We needed to improve the facades, and the storefronts, and help the business with those fundings, the storefronts, and rebuild, and cameras, and safety, and things of that nature. Some things were given, like festivals and things of that nature that would bring everybody together, but that helped to camouflage how great the neighborhood was, but yet, it was lacking, because you've got one side, Jones Hill, which is a little uppity, uppity, and it's got a little more bigger houses, and a little more money. You got one side over across towards the Dudley or Quincy area, and it's folks that are just low-income and still struggling to pay the rents. Yet, we found out that a lot of the building owners that were either empty buildings, at that time, all lived in Florida. I found two of them on a golf course in Florida and was able to bring them down to a community ... I would shut down the streets where one would live at and bring the neighborhood together. We found out how diverse the neighborhood was. People from, not only from the color of their skin, but just different backgrounds from different parts of the world.

Giving them a tote and they're already frustrated, the rents in Boston are ridiculous, so a lot of people became homeless because of that, then the war on drugs, which there really isn't but there's a lot of drugs here so drug people are migrating from other parts of the city and ending up in the middle of Boston. So I care that the government needs to deal with that issue, with this homelessness. Instead of giving these people a tote, give them a room and somewhere to live. I want our future mayors to realize this, you know what I'm saying? All that, \"Oh, you can leave your tent, here's a tote, we're not displacing you.\" It's about to be winter, they got plenty of vacant properties, that shelter that used to be on that island with the bridges, correct some of this and give those people a place to live.

I'm glad the commuter rail is just right up the street from where I live because I take the commuter rail. I no longer take the red line or the buses. I'll get on the commuter rail, go into work, go into the office. I'm so concerned when I get out of the office because I work at the C point area which is very safe. There's always tons of people walking around. There's the long wharf and then there's the international, Intercontinental, I'm sorry, Hotel so there's always a bunch of tourists around. There's always transit police and police because it's the downtown area so I'm not concerned so much walking from my office when it's dark at night, ask the eight o'clock to south station. But sometimes when I arrived Blue Hill Labs Station where I get off, there's a big old long platform and a big old long ramp. So what I did was I was, because sometimes people are just sitting there. I don't know, maybe, watching trains but it's late at night, they're just sitting there guys. So what I did was I asked the engineer, I said, \"Look, when you get to Blue Hill Avenue, could you possibly pull closest possible to that ramp?\" And he said, \"You ain't going towards the rebuilt area?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"That's a long platform.\" I said, \"Yes it is.\" And he said, \"That's a long ramp.\" And I said, \"I'm glad you know that.\" He said, \"I never know where to stop because some people do when they exit the train, they go towards the Blue Hill Lab but I go towards Cummins Highway because I live on that side.\" And most people it's maybe one or two people they will get off. Me and another woman or me and another guy but there's never more than two or three people that will get off at that stop. So he started pulling close as possible, going towards [inaudible] so I don't have to walk up the long platform to get to the ramp and then walk up the ramp. The ramp is so long, I don't know if anyone has ever taken the commuter rail or has entered that station, but they have benches that you could rest because it's so long. So lately there's been some crazy guys sitting on those benches with their mask on and stuff like and it's kind of scary too. You never know if someone's waiting there, they going to knock you upside your head or when you exit out of the station on Cummins Highway, they're doing construction up there so it's always kind of dark. The trucks and stuff are everywhere. When I'm crossing the street I'm always feeling nervous because those bike racks are in the way and then it's so dark that if you're walking across, the cars may not be able to see you and you don't know who may be they're waiting with a gun or whatever. I always think about the guys that were shot a few years ago at that barbecue. They're sitting in a car or outside of our car and then the grandmother that was just sitting on her porch and some random shooting or something like that. Where do these...

It's very funny to me how a lot of people see it as, \"Hey, I wish this could be my first language.\" And I'm like, \"No, I love that I can speak Spanish.\" And having that two language in the back pocket it's ideal because then when people think that you're from Cape Verde, which I get that I'm Cape Verding a lot. I don't see it, but, other people do. And they start talking behind you in Spanish, then you're like, neh, I know everything that you're saying, but it's okay. So, that resonated with me just a little bit. So, yeah."}, {"x": 7, "y": 11, "x_trans": 739, "y_trans": 577, "cluster": 9, "id": 5244807, "words": "I related to what Jasmine said, as a woman of color how can we access leadership opportunities to advance our careers? We have so many things that play against us, but at the same time we are important, so... And also, I'm very concerned about the housing issue that Doug mentioned. I think that's the number issue in the city. People are moving away, so who's going to stay in Boston? We talk about diversity, but how diverse is Boston going to be in the future if people are forced to move out?"}, {"x": 10, "y": 11, "x_trans": 947, "y_trans": 584, "cluster": 0, "id": 5244808, "words": "All right, Lina, do you want to go? All right. Well actually I wanted to lift up what you said about the dynamics that I think make housing such a problem here, which is that, I mean, there's population change. Lots of people coming in. People making more money, et cetera. But there's also this dynamic between... I think that you called out in your story, Lina, just about how a lot of decisions are made before people are even brought to the table. And I think that's a big challenge and a big problem. And especially when you do have a city where the former mayor proclaimed to build 70,000 new units of housing by 2030. A lot of it supposed to be affordable and yet you still have instances like what Lina just described, right, that still happens where developers can do their thing without really having to reckon with the community? So yeah, I just wanted to lift that up. But that's a problem that I also see that I'm interested in understanding more deeply and interested in learning about how we might change that. Yeah. And I think also, Joe, what you said at the very beginning just about... you said, \"Why is it so hard for a community investment to take place in the communities that maybe need it most?\" And that's just a question that I myself still have. How is it possible to do that in a way that ensures that people can stay where they are? Yeah, I just wanted to lift those two things up and say that I relate to them and that I'm also interested in figuring out how to solve them."}, {"x": 7, "y": 10, "x_trans": 748, "y_trans": 457, "cluster": 17, "id": 5244809, "words": "I was just going to say that I resonate maybe with pretty much everything everybody said. As I was listening to everybody, I always asked the question of whoever's coming into my neighborhood, whether it's my neighborhood or my neighboring neighborhood, \"What are you going to do for us in our neighborhood? How are you going to treat our neighborhood if I decide to let you in to my network of people to talk to them to figure out what they want? What is the end result? How are you going to represent us statistically? How are you going to talk about us in a way that highlights and celebrates all of our diversity?\" Which you were talking about Somala, which is something that I always talk about. And then, the other thing that we, well, I always think about is that the leadership comes in different forms and this is something that Jasmine said, and why is it that people are always looking for leadership to look a certain way? Leadership looks so different with so many different people in our neighborhoods. I often wonder about the youth in our neighborhood, everybody's looking for the shiny, bright youth in our neighborhood. What about the youth that are struggling? They could be shiny and bright too. Invest in them, which is something somebody else said. I'm sorry my memory's a little [inaudible]. But, why do we have to pick and choose who we speak to, and why do we need gatekeepers to protect our neighborhood and our neighbors? Why do we need to protect them? So, all this is all about the way City and institutions have treated our neighborhoods and the people that live here. I know that I raised two Afro-Latinas and they struggle so hard in the paths that they've chosen. One in trauma, following my footsteps, and the other one decided, she's at school, \"Everybody I'm just going into the Military.\" So it was a little shock. But she went into the Military where you don't see too many Latinas in the field that she's in. She's in chemicals. So, I struggle and fight with different institutions and different people for them to understand that our neighborhoods are worth fighting for and that we need to fight, not with each other, but to empower each other, which is something that you all have said in different ways. So I'm just all over the place because I agree with everything everybody said. And I have an accent but you only hear it when I'm angry and you only hear the southern part. You don't really hear the Puerto Rican side until I'm really, really upset.

So you start thinking, it's just not going to work. But, we are all passionate about it. We all want to see a better Boston and we're all willing to do the groundwork that nobody else wants to do to get it there. So, I'm very happy to be part of a group of people that are actually eager to do the work and are willing to do it.

But if I'm correct with that theme that I get some support.

We're just saying that... It made me think about maybe we've learned how to navigate it in a certain way and I'm going to put a little bit more thought into that because it is and it's present. But I also want to just say that in my travels I've seen it present in a lot of other places as well. No one is the champion of it. We're just champions of sports. We have some of the other stuff taken care of too.

New York definitely has its racism, without a doubt, [inaudible]. I think because Boston is almost like a big town and some people who grew up here get defensive about it and I think that pushes the narrative especially when some players are free to come here and experience racism and people get defensive. But, no doubt what Joe said, racism is everywhere. Even though I'm a transplant, I first came to Boston when I was really young, and one of my first experience of Boston was the whole Charles Stuart case, and I think that's another reason why, in addition to Boston, the Charles Stuart case, it created this whole I guess stereotype of Boston being a racist city.

People, family members are protesting every day because they're saying that their loved ones are not safe. And I could find out, but I don't know at this point how many were women, but I think the majority of them were women. And so, because of that, that really hits home. And who is responsible for this? A governor is running this state of Massachusetts. And there's been nothing said in terms of, we're bringing it to his attention and he has commented on this situation. So that's one of my questions. How do we make our neighborhood safer? That's the other thing that comes to mind with me is, are we doing all that we can with our youth, because it's not just in one area, it's in the whole sector of the city. If you who listen to the reports over the Summer, with young crime at hand, and I've been in this city a long time ago and it has never been this high and it doesn't seem like it's changing. I haven't given up on our city and I don't think that anybody in higher position should give up either. We have got to do better. We have got to do more with our youth. I know we just went through a pandemic which is another whole issue, but as I looked, as I search, I just don't think there are enough programs for our youth. We don't have enough programs. We don't have enough involvement. And we don't have enough involvement in terms of policing. We don't have enough of them being able out in the community, in the schools talking so that people don't feel like policing is just about pulling you over, pulling out a gun, you know what I mean?

It cannot just be play planting trees. And it cannot just be, oh, our trains and buses are now more fuel efficient. Okay. But that does not really get at solving the problem. So, yeah.

But everyone is just like, \"Oh, go to this neighborhood, then go to that neighborhood.\" And I think people don't think like why different neighborhoods are different. And I one of the things we always noticed, is just differences in education, differences in support system within each community. And I think like all these things make me think of how each community, with more help or with more funding, can be helped more. And have, for example, more safety within Boston. And I think a lot of people have concerns about going to different neighborhoods, just because of what they think that neighborhood is, or what each neighborhood could be like.

So it makes it very difficult to think of a future here in Boston, when you're dealing with a housing situation on a lease by lease basis, and not sure if you'll even be allowed, from the sense of a realtor or a homeowner, to even begin to look for places here in Boston.

So I don't know if that had any play in how much money we got because I know other schools like East Boston High got a lot of money. They went on field trips, almost once every two months. I went on probably like one field trip, a basketball game in my four years of high school there. So yeah, I just want to know what's up with that? Why are some schools getting more money than others? And how can we make it a more equal playing field to ensure that everyone gets a good high school experience, because I personally feel that mine wasn't as good.

And we will also wouldn't have soap sometimes, in the bathroom. I don't know, what was up with that either. I don't know if that has to do with funding or what was up with that.

I haven't been able to find one because it's crazy, they have too much demand and they don't have too many offers. Are they have any plans in place?

The funds that they receive versus the lack of funds that they have here in Boston, there is a huge difference. I don't know his name, the first one, was talking about that gap, where in their education that they received, it shouldn't happen. It shouldn't be that way.

But to even think that two thirds of everyone that lives in the Boston area, rent their house and they don't own it, that let you know that they just cost a lot of money. So it's like, I don't know if that could be fixed, but it will make a lot of people's life easier if it was. Excuse me. Since you share that, one of the things that you resonate with is the whole housing. Do you feel that it is within the whole city of Boston where we're lacking, we don't have enough homes that we can sell to people? I really want to hear from your point of view, what is different from you, living in Indiana and then coming here, is there more houses there that you can buy? Do we have more houses here that you can... Give us a little bit more about that. I'll say, because when we initially moved here, we stayed in a graduate housing at Harvard, because that's where my wife is going to school. And the apartment that we were paying for, just so you can see what I mean, cost the same as our mortgage on a house, our two cars and our insurance back home in Indiana, just for a two bedroom apartment."}, {"x": 8, "y": 12, "x_trans": 811, "y_trans": 708, "cluster": 6, "id": 5244874, "words": "Yomaira, okay.

And the traffic here has gone up by a lot. A couple years ago, it might have been a little bit bad, but now it's pretty bad. Especially in the mornings, when a lot of people that bought all these new apartments here, they usually go work in the city. So the tunnels, it's crazy, man. It's jam packed in the morning. So I think they should figure out a way, I don't know, maybe make a new road or something to help the traffic in that area. So yeah, I feel that's a pretty big problem right now, at least in East Boston. I don't know about other parts of Boston. So you feel that if there's less construction, it would equal less traffic or how does that impact you? Are you a driver? Are you a commuter? How is traffic impacting you in your own personal day? I would say in the train, a lot of the times I've noticed that now there's way more delays on the blue line. That's also the same line that's connected to the airport. So it might have to do with that too. Because you always got people coming in and out, that are leaving the airport or going to the airport.

When you have all these people moving in and you're pumping so much money into one space, the rent is bound to go up. And then that leads to usually, people of color and minorities getting pushed out due to all these people moving in because now they're not able to pay on rent anymore. They're used to paying X amount or something low and now the rent is increased and they can't afford it. They can't live like that. I know a lot of my friends that do rent in East Boston, they say that it's really, really high. And usually they have to have roommates. It's not like they could just live by themselves. They need maybe two or three roommates. So I feel like it shouldn't be like that. So we could just find a way to fix that.

So it's over 80% people of color. But there wasn't a lot of black males working there and there wasn't a lot of black females working there. And it's like, some of the teacher couldn't relate to.

They just came in, just shot at him. I'm not gonna say that he was innocent because I don't know what he was dealing with. We might say, \"That people are innocent, but we don't know what's really behind them.\" But it's still murder. Somebody still got killed, some people got shot, and this is our neighborhood. We supposed to be not scared of being around here. Our kids live here. My kids were like... When I moved her, it was 15 years ago, my kids they weren't little, but they were enough. And they never come outside. We go outside, we sit right in the stair. Don't go nowhere, don't move from there, because even walking, some other kids are bully's to them. Other kids are coming in and will hit them or whatever. So you don't want your kids to be hurt. You don't want to be living in fear. Your parent come and said, \"They don't do nothing for you.\" I've been here for 15 years, asking for a gate in my backyard. There's no... [inaudible] They told me that I'm going to get it if I move in. So I said, \"Okay, I'll take that if you're going to fix it later.\" I'm still waiting for him and they still didn't put no gate on.

And they all say they're going to do this, but I doubt that they do it, is get the people from different neighborhoods together. People who run neighborhoods, people like myself and Carmen from here and someone else from Brahmin and someone else from there and there, and ask them at a round table with the Mayor, the Governor and whoever else, what's going on and how to fix it? Because when I first started working here, this place used to be packed with kids. Now people don't even let their kids come out, unless we're going to go get them, walk them back home or whatever. And I don't blame them. When I lived in Bromley, we'd go out. When we grew up in Bromley, we had our own police, it was called Bromley Patrol and there was never shooting. Never, no one was doing violence. And we had a Team Center in every house [inaudible] around the city. Everybody did stuff together. We would bring all the developments together, that way there was never any conflict, but now they got everybody spaced out, no one likes each other, they fired all the workers. The only place that has a Senate that's open is Franklin Field and Bromley Heath and... Franklin Field and Bromley Heath that has an active running Task Force and Community Center and doing things for the people and the community. And we need that everywhere. We need the Mayor to come out here, talk to the residents and so the residents can tell them... because I don't think kids are really bad, they grow onto us. Because we got some kids in here, and they were good kids, but they started smoking dope, and now they come running across the field, they getting shot at. Those are the kids that were in here with us, and they were little kids. And now they grow up to be 14 and 15, they're only 14 and 15, they're still little kids. They have to cross the field and somebody is shooting at them. And this happened this summer. So I mean, it's a non-ending thing, it just keeps going and going and going and everything that we try to do is for nothing because the police used to come in here, every day. Shoot pools with the kids, they just got a new captain, he just got fired. They got a new captain, he took the police out of here. We had three officers who used to come here every day, shoot pools with the kids. Now, if you notice three police officers in here, everybody is going to send their kids in here because they know its safe. And they don't even have to stay in here. They would take their car from here, go out and come back. They were always here, that type of thing. Its things like that, is what the Mayor and the Governor need to know, that needs to be in community so that we could feel safe. Or just to have a car parked there. And take his car from there, they're riding around the city doing nothing. I'm serious. I see cop cars all over the place, they're not doing anything to me, they're on their cellphones, they're out there on detail making triple money. Why do they need the detail? If we are not safe, why should they be safe to be parking on the street. I'm talking about the people that are working tho.[crosstalk 00:46:29] in our neighborhood but they're not guarding us.

I'm mixed, I'm clearly mixed. Well I can't say that really. But I'm African and Southern European and just like, I heard stuff like people referring to me as like a member of Al Qaeda at the age of eight years old. Then like I remember I was walking to Boston Bowl and everybody knows Boston Bowl in Boston. I live near Boston Bowl. I still live in the same place and literally, I'm walking there to go play games at the arcade and I am now 11 at this point. A car full of young men, who are probably from a different part of Dorchester, they pulled up and they said, he said, \"Oh you know, where are the bombs? Can I get the bomb off of you now?\" Then they just all laughed. I heard the clinking of beers and they just drove off really fast and just like, that made me think of that. So I connected briefly in that moment to that. Then just like overall, about the schooling and what you were saying earlier, Bianca, about just the really big differences in the schooling and I think a lot about how like other of my peers, who also did get held back, didn't stay. They were just like, \"All right, if I'm going to get held back, then I might as well stay home, or I'll just go to another school where they don't even take attendance.\" Those are all really real things and some of those people who I'm just now mentioning, I see them, it was in the last five or six years and they were in prison, or they are imprisoned, incarcerated, or they are dead. I remember seeing the news and seeing my friend Rudy, who I knew was in foster care and stuff, he was in a shoot out with the police in like 2016 and he passed away as a result. I knew that his attendance was really bad, back in elementary school. So schooling has a huge impact on how a youth's life can turn out as an adult. Racism also, has a huge impact on how a youth can turn out as an adult. So you know, these are institutions of inequality. They were made this way for an original purpose that we could argue back and forth on for hours, but it's a matter of fact that our youth are getting harmed, in school and outside of school, on the way to playing games and stuff like that and not everybody can just tough it out and just whatever, pull them up by these imaginary bootstraps that we keep hearing about. Not everybody has a bootstrap to pull up, so.

So now I'm like, [inaudible]. But you know what I mean? Yeah, connotation and context is super important, like as far as the communities go. But I definitely resonate with the stories that you both shared. Obviously, as someone who lived in Roxbury and Grove Hall, my entire life and now I'm living in the North End, because it's more affordable than where I used to live, is like that's a direct result of the ways that my community is currently and has been gentrified. I think that it's important also to recognize that for many different people, their circumstances are different. You know what I mean? We have different lived experiences and different like economic, we have different I guess ideas of economic stability and lived experiences with that, as well. So my story is like very different from a lot of other people's, but being someone who is the youngest and I never take youngest sibling, you know what I mean, like slander, because I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. But yeah, you know what I mean? Like being the youngest of a household of four children, two of whom were like adopted. It's like, kind of the idea of community that I share, or that I have and that I hold dear, is like very different than a lot of other people. I definitely think that seeing the gentrification that's taking place right now, it's very reminiscent of how the community kind of felt very disparate when I was younger, do you know what I mean? Because, you have people that you're close to, you have your kind of blood relatives and your blood family members and stuff like that. But then you also have these like adopted family members who are like, you want to care about and who are like they're a part of your family and you go to love them and stuff like that. You know what I mean? That's your brothers, your sisters. You feel me? But at the end of the day it's like, there's still always going to be a divide. You know what I mean? I feel like the people that are moving into the neighborhoods, they're not to blame for the gentrification that's taking place. It's more so around the foundations that are being laid by the city to be able to have those people move in. You know what I mean? I think that divide is something that happens a lot. I saw that happen like my own household, just like with adopted siblings and myself. You know what I mean, with my birth mom and sister, it's just like, it's easy for us to fight each other and kind of not like each other, because it's like, \"Oh you're this and this and you know whatever.\" But it's not really conducive to an environment that we can all grow and thrive in. You feel me? Like there can be like space for people to be able to live in affordable housing and I mean there can be [inaudible] folks who are, you know what I mean? Like whether they're a part of the artist community or they're a part of the business community, whatever, to be able to find space. Because there shouldn't be that, like one group of people shouldn't be pushed out for another group of people to be able to thrive. You feel me? I feel like until the city has that in mind, so that concept gets through their skulls, we're not going to be able to have a clear understanding of who, of what community actually feels like. You feel me? I think that's difficult, just because obviously we have, you know what I mean?

I think what we probably need is some hope, a breath of fresh air. One of the things someone comment on, is the voting and everyone concentrate on the presidential vote. I think, I'm not speaking for him, but I think in my mind, when Obama was running, we were hopeful. \"Wow, things are getting better.\" And I think that's what we need in our community right here in Boston.

Hi, wow.\" One thing about me is that if I'm accomplishing things and getting better, I want... in my business, if I'm making money, everyone else is making money with me, all my employees got to grow with me.

And that's why you got folks coming from other parts of the city into Boston, because the other parts of the city are not feeding them drugs, are not giving them that methadone, are not letting them just do what they want to do.

You have shops over there at South Bay that I don't understand how they're still in business when them junkies going over there rob them every single day. And security guards can't do nothing about it because of the police reform bill.

They tell her, \"Oh, go on food stamps.\" Food stamps says she makes too much money. And now, as an adult myself, I can see real fast why she would have those problems.

Well, like I said, it was discouraging, dropping out of maybe a counseling program when I was probably wanting to talk somebody or dealing with something personal. So it's almost like you're starting over or you got to deal with all those issues yourself. So maybe something expired, or I'd miss a counseling session because of it.

Basically, when you go in the tent, you can bring whatever you want.

Sometimes you have to have it where it's promoted, where there would be, like how a lot of the community gets together when we have festivals or we have carnivals and things like that, I think that's a great way to get people to come together and try to bring some type of change, like maybe some type of campaign where you can present it to them and they'll be willing to get involved that way. Sometimes you have to draw people in with, not saying it has to be something attached to it, but it's almost like there's a time and a place to deal with in order to get people to really get involved.

So my connection to my question would be with Jamie. And I resonate with her question and her response, because that happened to my son as well. He was very social, and the pandemic really crumbled him down to almost just a shell. And where someone is just starting off their life at 18, it seems so sad that you would get to this point, but it was out of your control. So it's like, how do you help him? And even as myself as a mental health advocate and counselor, it was hard for me to work from within the home because I'm always working with clients outside of the home. So when it hit home that my son was depressed and like, he just didn't want to get up for school. Like he would roll to the bed and wake up, turn the laptop on and be in class in the bed and just not present at all. So it was so sad to watch that for, like, he struggled to get out of school. And the way the school system was set up, it was like they did everything to ease the kids so they could just get out. But to me, I still think that they weren't ready. The pandemic did push them back, but because of what was needed, like through policy or government, that they had to get these kids out of these seats for the next batch to come in. And also with making them come back in this year, I don't know, to me it was like a force as well, because a lot of people are still getting sick. But just having that reflection of young people just going into a shell, it really resonated with me that that also occurred. And that was on the day of the shutdown where my son actually, he just went missing. He just kept walking around and hanging with friends. We had no idea where he was. And that was the scariest time that I ever experienced something like that with one of my own children. I'd never saw that happening with him because he knows how we are and how we'll wrap our arms around him. So it was just so, like... I guess I was out of this world. Yeah. Because it was like, we couldn't find him, the pandemic happened, they sent the kids home, we don't know what's going on. And it just was, yeah, bananas, pure chaos. But where I'm trying to work him back into society, so he's gotten a little job and he's moving through.

Like just a different child, like, \"I don't even know who you are and you're here every day\" type thing. And then also for me, also the social interaction, which I feel like I lost out on before the pandemic, because I had a baby and just stuff was changing. And not having access to specific resources to help myself move forward because people just go to work and go to work and just go to work. But when you're unhappy and you go to work, you don't want to go to work because I don't want to do that. That's not something that I want to do, so I don't want to go there. So then that was a depression, I fell into a very deep, dark depression because of that, because I knew that that's not what I want to do. You know? Like this is, \"I don't want to do this. I don't want to go there. I don't want to talk to these people. I don't want to look at them. I don't want to see them,\" and I became very closed off. And then I'm trying to insert myself back into the regular world, and I see that it's not normal, it's not regular. People are just not the same. And it, to me, I don't think it ever will be.

How can we keep the neighborhoods together? How can we unify?

Even starting from within my own household, even starting from within the family, like I've noticed so much from doing all the readings and the research and all that. It's like, it's really there, but why was that always frowned upon that this is the buildup that's going to burst as to why nothing got done about it, or people didn't know how to speak to their physicians or just bring it out. It was like, what happens in the house stays in the house. Mm. And that's not always a good way to rear children or young youth, because it's like, \"All right, so what do I tell? What do I not? But I still need this help.\" So it's, I don't know, it's always been so confusing, but when it happened for my child, I made sure to do everything that I could. And even though I wasn't an advocate for mental health at that time, I knew that it was something that was real. Even though I don't like the way that it was brought up from the school system, because sometimes people don't have of empathy for ways that they deliver messages. So it was kind of, you get on the defense first, before you really accept what was being said about your child or what they noticed. Right. So that needs to be taken account of, like a revamp for those resources in the school to get them some kind of training as well when they deliver those kind of messages to parents about their observance of their student or that person's child. But yeah, so mental health is still really a big forefront because if you don't have sense of self, everything around you is going to always be in pieces. Hm. Okay. So you start in there to get those pieces together so that you can have the coping skills, you can have mechanisms that you can reach for and resources for people that you can reach out to. So, that's my main concern. And to piggyback off with Ms. Carol, the crime is really getting ridiculous. I sat here the other night, and I did hear that those 25 shots that that person got dumped in the other day up on Walk Hill. And I could sit...

Actually right when the Long Island shelter was closed, right before the hundred inches of snow that we got that winter and I'm grateful and privileged and blessed to have gotten housing after a few months of that. But I observed like when I go over to doctor's appointments over at BMC or being around methadone bile or mass and cast, as some people call it and the situation has gotten more out in the open and it makes me sad and just disappointed to see people not housed. I know that there's some small group that like to be outside because it's hard to be in a shelter, but I don't feel like the city is really doing enough. And I realized that it takes time to build housing, but I wish the city would make an even more stronger stance. And I don't mean just treatment, but having things like there's something called the housing first model where you don't put a ton of rules in front of someone and say, \"You have to be six months sober or you have to stay in the shelter for three months before we'll fill out your verification of homelessness form.\" All these things that just make it that much harder. It's harder to be sober when you're out on the streets. And so, I feel if we had a more listed... I mean, I can't have all the solutions, it's complicated and we could spend literally a whole day talking about just this topic. So for me, I'd like to see the homeless get more shelter and get housing and also to people who've lived here for decades and have been here, I don't like seeing people pushed out to the suburbs, to other states.

And then more recently, my work is very focused on, housing and neighborhood planning work and know people's control of their own space. Yeah. I think struggle is... You can't eliminate struggle in the human experience and suffering, but struggle based on, to borrow from Bruce, because of how or where we were born into. Struggles as a result of all the things that divide us. What does a place look like where everybody can be? And by be, I don't mean like coexist without tension. I mean, where we can express ourselves fully and not be worried about getting food on the table and at whatever, whether you're fortunate enough to be, gainfully employed, have a career or wherever you are on the various spectrums of life, to feel whole and to have a rich spiritual and community life.

We used to go into Lower Allston or even Little Italy or even North End, and those kind of areas, you don't really see any of these operators or even businesses in that area. So to say, there is a restriction between Boston and Natives and then coming back to Bruce's ideal is why can't we not all live in peace, but for understanding is the reason why we can't leave in peace because we live under different tax brackets. So as me, I'm a Roxbury native. I could go as far as South End and feel included because there's many Latinos living there. But as a Roxbury native, when I was working in Cambridge, I felt excluded. I felt like I wasn't a part of that neighborhood, even though that neighborhood is, it's two cities in one. So it's very difficult to say or to view that. Okay, I'm from Boston, I'm from the bean, I'm a Red Sox fan. I'm the official patriarch. There's things of that nature, where we are all implemented in, but at the same time, we can't just all cross each other's regions. So my thing is when is it that it's going to be acceptable as me as a Roxbury native, that I'm accepted in Downtown Boston? Now it's very hard because I know the city has different on plans where they're putting in new housings, they're putting in new programs that doesn't really abide by Boston residential people. It only abides by people outside of the city or the ones that are coming in because Boston is technically known as the hub. So being the hub, that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world. So being that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world. And a couple years ago, we was known as the number one city in the country. So my thing is, when is it that the people from our city are going to be accepted in our city? Because we're the ones who make Boston real. We're the ones who make it, the way it is, the persona of being a Bostonian, is not these out of state people. That's my difficulty of understanding.

That wasn't even a channel to turn to, if you will. Over all of our wars as this country, there been no notifications and the name has changed to protect the innocent. But at same time, you did not see the numbers of homelessness that you do now. And again, it's started in a very different time. You also had a situation under I believe, maybe Ronald Reagan, if any youngins can remember that, where the deinstitutionalization of folks who had issues not necessarily war related, but had mental health issues, spiritual issues that were in an essence turned out into the streets. Because the theme at the time is, well, we can find a place for them to come and get their medication. And they can self medicate, and blah, blah, blah, which was absolute down to Coca Cola. Now you move to a time now, where the bottom is beginning to become thicker, because of our social economic situation, Nancy spoke to and please don't misunderstand. But her position as a white person in Boston, even with that, there were prevailing kinds of situations economically, socially, that have now thickened again, the bottom of people who otherwise would not have the same worries or concerns. And how do we take that super huge problem and crystallize it and stop the life out of it, if you will, to bring it to the larger body because the body of people who are falling under that social economic state is growing. And it's including everybody, people who maybe once thought that they were safe. When you think about homelessness and you think about people in this town, in this city, who are second generation homeless. I'm not talking about just falling off to a corner somewhere.

What is the purpose of this place? Is it because right now to me it feels like it's like a cash cow, it's like property, property, property, speculation, the housing market.

So I definitely have my own view and my own interpretation of things that I see and things that happen around me. And the one thing that my father was constantly working to drill and instill in us is to know and to understand who's at the table. And he was one of those people that, if there wasn't a table, he'd build one. And you don't leave people out. The best way to have a community conversation is to have everyone from the community. Those close by, even those folk who are far away, you include them in the conversation. And I look at where we are now on my street, on Brinsley street. We used to know everybody on our street. We used to know all of our neighbors. So when you talk about the kids having things to do and places to go, that wasn't so much an issue because all of our households had a hand in making that happen for kids. I can truthfully say to you now that I can't really walk out my front door and call anyone by name. My neighbor to my left has a lot of kids. And her kids call me neighbor, because I'll do stuff for them, I'll buy ice cream or treats or whatever, hand it to them. But they see me and they go, \"Hi neighbor.\" That's our life now. It used to be that we knew them, they knew us. We knew about each other. We knew how to help each other. It was more than just a casual wave to someone, \"Hey, how you're doing?\" So, that's missing. So now I think that in our community conversations... I think much like this call, it needs to be intergenerational. It's got to have Gail on the call, and I should be on the call and Marilyn should be there. We need Shamika and David to be there, to bring that perspective that oftentimes is beyond us because we are not thinking along that vein anymore. So we need to be cognizant of who's at the table, and then we need to make a concerted effort to make certain that if we're not there, we get them there.

I've been working in one regard, the other with young people for the last 10 years and just doing life with them, spending time with them, mentoring, hanging out, just seeing this consistent theme of young people, especially brown and black young people, not feeling like they have anywhere to go when stuff is going wrong around them. And when they're facing a trial or something, or trauma or whatever it may be. So many times it's either they turn to their peers or they're keeping it in, or unfortunately, turn into other things to try and fill that void. And so I spent a lot of time working with young people in the context of the church. And so, a lot of it is spiritual-based, but as I grew older, I just really felt this need of, \"We can do more for these young people, than have them for two hours at a church service on a Friday night.\" And so for me, it was just very looking for, \"How do I find a holistic way to be of service to young people, to see them get access to more than just mental health resources, but healthier food, education?\" And even this past summer, I encountered so many kids who just legitimately so intelligent, so smart. Even more than me, but [inaudible] for them, they don't want to go to school, they don't want to take classes, but it's so... Just tension of seeing the brilliance in them, that the things that they're passionate about, they're so gifted in, but then just having no desire to apply to the certain areas in school, or you even just like... Sometimes high school is just the end. They're like, \"Let me just... I'll finish high school and then whatever happens, happens.\" And oftentimes there's not this... They don't often see that path or that way forward. And I think Shamika, you mentioned something earlier about, or maybe I can't remember it was [inaudible], helping these kids finding that hope again. And so being able to say, \"Hey, there is actually a path forward for me to success.\" And, yes, if that's [inaudible], but success doesn't have to be limited to getting a bachelor's. Especially in 2021, there are so many different ways that you can find success and make money and be happy and achieve all those goals. So it's really trying to find ways that these teens can actually envision a future. And it did surprise me this summer by hearing just how many of our teens didn't have that plan or even have that thought. And so hoping that in these conversations, and as we elevate more voices and elevate more youth voices, that we can start to bring back some of those things and some of those programs that show our kids and show our community in general, that there is a path forward, there is a way forward. And so that's just really where I'm at and how I've gotten here."}, {"x": 9, "y": 9, "x_trans": 922, "y_trans": 429, "cluster": 4, "id": 4263502, "words": "Growing up on Waldeck street, we had [inaudible] House, had a lot of programs that we used to use.

I did my best just to keep them occupied in any activity that I found, even though they were outside of Dorchester, because it was hard to find anything nearby for them. So I just searched someplace else out of [inaudible] and that shouldn't be the case. In fact, we should have more resources for the kids, more activities for them to be able to go and attend. And I know it could be expensive, so we should have programs that are free for parents just to get these kids involved in getting them off the streets, because my [inaudible] kids off the street.

So I think that, for this conversation to move forward, for the work to move forward, it's going to be so vital that we are leaning on everyone in this conversation. Those who have been through it and know what it takes to win the fight. And those after who are going to have those fresh ideas, those new ideas, the creative ways that problems are going to be solved. What worked in 94 may not work in 2021, but that doesn't mean the principles have changed. That doesn't mean that the things that are going to be required, the sacrifices that are going to be required have changed. And sorry, I feel like I've been a little bit all over the place on this stuff. I'm just thinking out loud, but for me, this past hour has just being a reminder of...

Yes, I do. I did not know that. Yes. 52. And I have a son that's 32. So I've been through all of those phases. Let's see. I had an exchange with three young ladies the other day. I had my best girlfriend of 65 years, had passed away and she [inaudible] a clothes horse. So I've given many things away to women that I knew going back into the workplace and all of that. But I still had quite a few things leftover. So last Friday I said, \"Well, let me just hang them outside on the fence and put a free sign up there.\" Well, these three young ladies... Oh, I'd say, one was probably about five years old, 10 years old. And one that was 12, 13. And when they stopped at the house, my husband was outside washing his car and, and they said, \"Sir are these free.\" And he says, \"Yeah, it's free, take whatever you want.\" So I heard them talking among themselves. And so I went outside and they said, \"Ma'am, is that your husband?\" I said, \"Yes, he is.\" \"He said, these were free.\" I said, \"Yes they are.\" And so they said \"Free? Why aren't you selling it?\" I said, \"Well, because I know there are people in the community that could use it.\" I mean, there were a lot of clothes that still had the tags on them and everything. So they just said, \"Oh my goodness, our grandmother would love these things.\" They were very deliberate and thoughtful in the things that they had picked out. Then this one turned to me and said, \"Miss, do you have any church hats?\" \"I'm sorry that I don't have.\" So got them a bag. They left here with so many things. The gratitude and the thoughtfulness of those three young ladies. So they said, \"Well, grandma likes skirts. Do you have any skirts?\" I said, \"Oh, I have plenty of skirts.\" So I brought them down. So they even chose a couple of items that they said that they could use as night-shirts. [crosstalk] So the oldest said, \"Are you going to be around tomorrow?\" I said, \"Yes, I will be.\" She says, \"I'm going to try to get my grandma to come down so she can pick out things for herself.\" That little interaction with those little angels, it was like a rebirth for me.

And I would like to see that type of community, that type of neighboring, throughout the city of Boston. That's right. But as I always used to tell people, especially when we were going through all the drug stuff during the late eighties, early nineties and stuff. People didn't understand what was missing. They would say, \"Oh, these young children, they're throwaways. They're no good.\" And all that sort of stuff. \"They don't know how to respect people.\" And my premise was always that, \"You have to give respect to receive respect.\" [inaudible 01\"00:03:37] what a lot of them just needed was to be respected or someone to just say, \"Hello\" to them, acknowledge them. And once we started doing that, it was received. Because I'll tell you, we have real tough bangers, especially on this street. And I'll tell you, once you started giving them the respect of being a human, someone of value, it changed. They still come to my home. So I know that change can happen.

Is that we all talked about community in one sense or another. And the thing about my community, my street, is that we went from families who had lived there for decades, to my street now being very transient. People coming and going, people moving in, moving out. No longer family homes, family dwellings from generation to the next. But I think as I was listening to Gail, the thing that comes to mind for me is that it's like not having an infrastructure. It's like not building an infrastructure, so that everybody who comes in, they come into something new. Imagine what it would be like if your community or your street is one that [inaudible] somebody new comes in, you realize they're new to the street. You welcome them for being new to the street, as opposed to looking at them and saying, \"Okay, I wonder how long they going to be here. I wonder how many cars they have. I wonder how many parking spaces are they going to take up?\" I mean, because that's just a reality now. But imagine that if we were in that time, when we actually made it a point to get to know people so that your street has an identity, your street has a culture. So that as people are coming in, it's not a chore to convince people to come to neighborhood association meetings, because the first time they see it or hear about it is not when you are shoving a notice in their mailbox, it's because you've actually had a conversation with them and you've mentioned it to them, you've told them about it. So that when it happens, you can say, \"Oh, remember I told you about that meeting, would you like to come with me?\" And I think that we have moved so far... I'm saying \"move.\" Maybe we haven't grown or we have dissolved, I'm not even sure what it is, but I just know that we have moved away from that. And I'm just thinking that if we had something that even resembled that... Businesses and organizations survive when they have an infrastructure, right? When they have funds, when they have... So that there can be a transition from one, there's nothing worse than having a pastor leave a church, because the whole church falls apart if you don't have an infrastructure, you don't have something in place."}, {"x": 7, "y": 11, "x_trans": 664, "y_trans": 578, "cluster": 10, "id": 4212986, "words": "my story is, my family has been here about 55 years, but back when I was born, there was the problem with desegregation, and I was shipped to Cambridge, where I matriculated for the first six years of my life. Then I left Cambridge and I went to... I had the advantage of public education, then I went into a private situation, and I was there for about three years. And then I left and went to another private situation because my parents were adamant they were going to keep me out of Boston. Then my children were born. I have twins, a daughter and a son. My son is somewhat challenged, so he was in special education. I lived in a town that I don't want to name right now, but to make a long story short, I had a fire. My house burned, and they kicked me son out of school three times. I had to get an education attorney, and I had to, because as long as we stayed homeless, he had stay-put rights, so I stayed homeless. In my car and families' houses, and the whole nine. That's my next book. To keep my son in his special education program, because he was in middle school, and it was a pivotal time. I did not want him in Boston, however the town had a detective following us around. And the detective came to the hearing at the Department of Education and gave sworn testimony, which was a lie, a humongous lie, and so we lost our case. He got kicked out of the town, and ended up in Boston. Then I had to eat that, because Boston kept him back, and I wasn't happy with that. So yes, I have a story, I have some wounds, and I would like to know that for the future, education is going to be better. I think trades need to brought back, everybody can't handle college. College isn't the answer like we've been duped to believe. It's gotten us debt, so that's my contribution.

Different kinds of flavor, and you could walk into these spaces and get that kind of flavor, that kind of culture, that kind of... All those things that come along with food.

You're starting to see places go into Malden and Quincy, and that's cool. I'm glad that places are still existing, but those places, some of them used to be in Boston. On the more positive front, I'm also starting to see some new spaces coming up, like 50 Kitchen, in Dorchester, that's a pretty awesome spot. There's a couple real cool spots out in... I mentioned Somerville, but I know my friend Elliot has a restaurant called Tanam, that's out near Bow Street Market, so there's these little gems that I'm starting to see, but not as fast as these other places are going away.

I kind of had a suspicion, but I found out, literally like two days ago, that I had an IEP growing up. I grew up working lower middle-class, so I went to the poor school in my town, in New Hampshire. Even though it was under resource, relative in that community, I still could get access to a speech pathologist. I still got access to certain supports. So when I moved to Boston, that's when I was mentioned when I went and worked at the Burke High School, it was just wild to see how under... There were really wonderful students and really committed teachers, but no relative resources. There was like four staff members that were socio emotionally supported, and they only got that because they were a turn around school. So they get money to be in turn around, to avoid going into receivership, but once they get out of turn around, they lose the extra funding. The students that were coming to school and trying to learn every day... One of the students I was working with, I found out at the very end. Like, I worked for all year and he struggled all year, coming into school, and at the end of the year, I was chatting with him. I called his family and did other things like that, and he told me. \"Mr., to be honest, I've been homeless almost the entire time.\" And I'm like, \"Jesus.\" That would have totally changed my approach, and I don't think a lot of the people at the school actually knew. I think they would have tried, but there was just... I think it was not a lack of will or care for these students, cause teachers and staff were amazing, it was they were students who had... Because it was a mostly Black and Brown school, so many intersecting issues that the students face, and there was just no capacity to do it. So I think that just really struck me, just thinking about myself. Like even in my town, I had challenges relative to that, but I was like, \"My life would have been so different,\" and to what folks are saying, it's material. This has material impact on people's lives. If I didn't have access to that support, I have no idea where I would be, so I think that just makes that level of building, not just education, but also ensuring that we're expanding what education means, beyond what we currently think it is. Including those soft skills, including the socio emotional skills, including... Find better words for me. Cultural incompetent, which I don't like that word. But the idea of valuing and other cultures, and recognizing that if you're working with someone, you need to value their background, so you can actually work with them in a way that's relevant to them. And I agree, that's very, very lacking. And to the same degree, a lot of students in that school and other, where I also worked at, Hyde Square Task Force in Jamaica Plain, a lot of those students, even though it's in Jamaica Plain, a lot of their families are being forced out into Brockton, or into other places, or being displaced. So it's very clear who the city, the power structures, and the White supremacist power structures in the city, are favoring, and who they think should live here.

They're building up my neighborhood, all over the place, and I'm like, \"I know who you're building to live there, but no one... \" It's just bonkers to me, to be destroying what actually has kept Boston. Like what has made it a place that people can actually live and want to go to. Cause a lot of people say it's not very friendly and that it's very professional and too fast. I'm like, \"There's a reason for that.

And the other thing is the tyranny that goes along with we voted for cannabis and consumption, and the stigmatization that went along with people who did smoke cannabis. And then you have these judges that lock up a lot of cannabis users. And now some of these judges, I wouldn't say all of them, but I wouldn't be surprised if they're not in the cannabis industry. Those judges that sent these young, and I say black and brown and Latino people to jail including my loved one. My family was incarcerated because they were an addict and they used drugs to provide for their addiction. What about crime? But they still did jail time unlike the addicts of today that they want to find them injection centers. They're not injection centers but there are places where they can go and indulge in the activity of their choice. They want to provide shelters for these addicts of today. They want to put them on Front Street in the prime areas where there's business owners. There's a black hotel down there. We won't even know that it's a black hotel. When it was open, we did very much go over there and have a great time, but now with the drug addiction people that are surrounding those areas who's helping those business owners to get back to the level where they deserve to get the revenue that they deserve. But because of the eyesore like where's that conversation at. And the consumerism, we can go into the cigar bars and you can go into the bars and you can do hookah, and you can do cigars. You can't do cannabis, but we voted for that, like you owe us that. There's tyranny there. And who's talking about that? It's not okay. It's just not okay.

We don't see that in the urban community unless you go down to City Hall and you're aware of ... We'll just go over all of it. If you're aware of the protocol that they have for that. And the last thing is Nathaniel Holland Fenway Park. Those parks are for the people, but the people can't use them. In other words, there was just a write-up in the Globe that Fenway had never had lined the Urban Act in the whole history of the Fenway Park. I have never, ever wanted to say, \"Hey son, let's go to Fenway Park for an hour.\" Never, and I take my kids on a lot of outings. And the other thing is the youth center, when I played football and one of the things I always was very happy about in all the years that I played with my children is when we go to those games the people who support them always had a banner, so we knew who the business owners that support our children.

There was a lull for like two or three years where it didn't seem like anyone could buy anything. You know what I'm saying? With the whole watching ... Like I said, with watching housing change where there were housing being sold, three family homes, like I live in Dorchester. For instance, living here in Dorchester versus someone who may live in Roxbury where they started talking about the word regentrification. To be on this side of how everyone had to highlight on Roxbury, I'm one of the people who living here in this community would say that Dorchester is being regentrified, and no one was paying attention to that because like I said the three family homes were being sold, but they're being sold and they're being turned into condos, and how do you turn a three family home and all of a sudden start saying that these are condo floors, and each floor now costs $360,000 versus a home, that whole home would run you $500,000. You know what I'm saying? I personally witnessed that. That's where my question comes from with the formula in pricing based of ... Where I think the housing crash happened, it took away, I think, the American dream of a hard working person owning a home and being able to own a home and say possibly use one of their floors to be their small business or like I said a second income. That's what I've seen with the what happened to housing since 2008, and the way that is continuing. That's a part of the whole plan of where she says the whole plan of before was what was Boston going to look like in 2020, and now the whole vision is 2030, and just that part like where is rent going to go from here if an average three bedroom apartment if you can get it to say apartment and not condo is running like $2,200, $2,300 and more. There's something a lot of people who have decent jobs that work for the T, that work for the police, I work for the city, one of the city department divisions, and that's astronomical to be asking somebody to spend $2,000 a month.

So as a little girl watching this, my mom walking around the house with a football helmet because bricks was coming through the windows. It got so back the Black Panthers actually came to Maverick projects to help us, to assist us because the cops never ever did anything for us. So my whole life I've endured this kind of racism on the police force, as a parent living in the projects in South Street watching my son and his friends being harassed constantly by the police. And there's never ever, in my opinion, my own experiences, there's never ever been anything but racism that I've seen. And then I think about the black cops. When are you going to show up for us? You're sitting in the cruisers with these folks. I was arrested for trying to defend my son in my home. Called them to my home. I'm in the back of a cruiser, and the white boy, because that's what they are to me, says to me, \"What do you do for a living?\" As he's transporting me to the jail, and I said, \"None of your business.\" And his response to that was, \"Probably nothing. You're just like the rest of them collecting a check.\" [inaudible]. That's what we endure. And at this age, 61 years old still enduring that kind of racism in the police force, so what is going to be done? Who's going to help us? We need some assistance with these folks that are supposed to protect and serve. I think it's just generational racism. Who are they now? The white boys that were busting my windows out, who are they now? Where are they now? Are they teaching my grandchildren with that racist spirit? Is this why our kids can't learn because you talk about generational wealth, what about generational racism? That's what I've endured.

There's a lot of walks and different things for breast cancer and different things like that, but there's no things that minorities know about or feel comfortable participating in.

It was because of the workers that worked at the hospital. After the doctor does the procedure you go to the- The nurse in the recovery room. Yeah, like the staff. And those people there are people who they might want to be a nurse, didn't make the nurse or whatever. One of the guys happened to use drugs, and I accused him of taking my drugs.

If we don't get something in gear... We don't have buildings that are adequate. They don't even have air conditioning. You've got mice in the stairwell. Kids are getting moldy lunches. And yet and still, you tell me there's a budget for school lunch, but then you're serving the kids salami. What are you doing with the money realistically? Because I know all of the money that's in budget is not being dwarfed by a sandwich of cold salami. Someone really needs to think about why everybody's pushing their kids to charter school, because no one wants their kid in a Boston public education, because it's not there. So that's key, because you can't have the next level working force of these educated kids, if they're not educated. And then you wonder why they're hanging on the corners, because a lot of times the parents get discouraged. They can't keep track of the kids. The kids feel burdened, because they see their moms struggling. And then they go and resort to things, so that they can try and help. And then they end up being profiled, and then they end up being in a system. And then you end up with all the things that are happening every day on the news. And then they look at us like we're savages, and we don't know what we're doing. But a lot of times you have kids raising kids. If you've got young kids, and then they don't have that matriarch to give them the education, to give them the knowledge that they need and the support and structure. So if the services were there, if the housing was out of the way, and they weren't worried about the landlord kicking them out or raising their rent or whatever the case, or family members having to stay with them, because they've been kicked out, we'd have less struggle there. And therefore, they could concentrate on other things and give the kids the attention, be at the parent teacher meetings, like they should be, and be involved, and be a voice in the community like they should. So if we had had a seat at the table, if we were offered more of these seats on these boards, where the decisions were being made... Decisions are being made without even considering us, and we're just supposed to take the after effects. And that becomes stifling, you know?
